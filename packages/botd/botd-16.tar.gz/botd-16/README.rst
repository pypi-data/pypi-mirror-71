=============

you can download with pip3 and install globally:

::

 > sudo pip3 install botd

You can also download the tarball and install from that, see https://pypi.org/project/botd/#files

if you want to develop on the bot clone the source at bitbucket.org:

::

 > git clone https://bitbucket.org/bthate/botd

if you want to run the bot 24/7 you can install BOTd as a service for
the systemd daemon. You can do this by running the following:

::

 > sudo bcmd install

if you don't want the bot to startup at boot, remove the service file:

::

 > sudo bcmd remove

C O N F I G
===========

to configure the bot use the ed (edit) command, with sudo:

::

 > bcmd cfg server=<server> channel=<channel> nick=<nick>
 > bcmd hup

U S A G E
=========

BOTD detects whether it is run as root or as a user. if it's root it
will use the /var/lib/botd directory and it it's user it will use ~/.botd

BOTD has it's own CLI, you can run it by giving the bot command on the
prompt, it will return with its own prompt:

::

 > bot
 > cmds
 cfg|cmds|ed|find|fleet|meet|ps|udp
 >

you can use bcmd with arguments to run a command directly:

::

 > bcmd cmds
 cfg|cmds|ed|find|fleet|meet|ps|udp

if you run with sudo, you will get additional command like ed,install,remove and hup:

::

 > sudo bcmd cmds
 cfg|cmds|ed|find|fleet|hup|install|meet|ps|remove|udp


R S S
=====

to add an url use the rss command with an url:

::

 > bcmd rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
 ok 1

run the rss command to see what urls are registered:

::

 > bcmd rss
 0 https://news.ycombinator.com/rss

the fetch command can be used to poll the added feeds:

::

 > bcmd fetch
 fetched 0

U D P
=====

using udp to relay text into a channel, use the okudp program to send text via the bot 
to the channel on the irc server:

::

 > tail -f /var/log/syslog | bcmd udp

to send the tail output to the IRC channel, send a udp packet to the bot:

::

 import socket

 def toudp(host=localhost, port=5500, txt=""):
     sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
     sock.sendto(bytes(txt.strip(), "utf-8"), host, port)

    bot.itr             - introspect
    bot.krn             - core handler
    bot.obj             - base classes
    bot.prs             - parse
