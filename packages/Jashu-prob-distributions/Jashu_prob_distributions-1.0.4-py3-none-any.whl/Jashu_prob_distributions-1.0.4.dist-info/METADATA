Project description

# Jashu-prob-distributions package


This package provides the Gaussian distribution and Binomial distribution classes.

* Gaussian - Gaussian distribution class for calculating and visualizing a Gaussian distribution.
Attributes:
mean (float) - representing the mean value of the distribution.
stdev (float) - representing the standard deviation of the distribution.
data_list (list of floats) - a list of floats extracted from the data file.

Methods:
calculate_mean() - Function to calculate the mean of the data set.

calculate_stdev() - Function to calculate the standard deviation of the data set.

plot_histogram() - Function to output a histogram of the instance variable data using matplotlib pyplot library.

read_data_file(filename) - Function to read in data from a txt file. The txt file should have one number (float) per line. The numbers are stored in the data attribute.

pdf(x) - Probability density function calculator for the gaussian distribution
Args:
x (float): point for calculating the probability density function
Returns:
float: probability density function output

plot_histogram_pdf(n_spaces = 50) - Function to plot the normalized histogram of the data and a plot of the probability density function along the same range
Args:
n_spaces (int): number of data points
Returns:
list: x values for the pdf plot
list: y values for the pdf plot

__add__(other) - Function to add together two Gaussian distributions
Args:
other (Gaussian): Gaussian instance
Returns:
Gaussian: Gaussian distribution

__repr__() - Function to output the characteristics of the Gaussian instance



* Binomial - Binomial distribution class for calculating and visualizing a Binomial distribution.
Attributes:
mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
data_list (list of floats) a list of floats to be extracted from the data file
p (float) representing the probability of an event occurring
n (int) number of trials

Methods:
calculate_mean() - Function to calculate the mean from p and n

calculate_stdev() - Function to calculate the standard deviation from p and n.

read_data_file(filename) - Function to read in data from a txt file. The txt file should have one number (float) per line. The numbers are stored in the data attribute.

replace_stats_with_data() - Function to calculate p and n from the data set
Args:
None
Returns:
float: the p value
float: the n value

plot_bar() - Function to output a histogram of the instance variable data using matplotlib pyplot library.

pdf(k) - Probability density function calculator for the gaussian distribution.
Args:
x (float): point for calculating the probability density function
Returns:
float: probability density function output

plot_bar_pdf() - Function to plot the pdf of the binomial distribution
Args:
None
Returns:
list: x values for the pdf plot
list: y values for the pdf plot

__add__(other) - Function to add together two Binomial distributions with equal p
Args:
other (Binomial): Binomial instance
Returns:
Binomial: Binomial distribution

__repr__() - Function to output the characteristics of the Binomial instance.
