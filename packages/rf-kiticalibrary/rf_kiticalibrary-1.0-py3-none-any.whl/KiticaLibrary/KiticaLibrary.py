    A test library providing device pool support for testing.

        ``KiticaLibrary`` is a Robot Framework third party library that \
        enables test to borrow available user from a device pool. These \
        allows test to run in CI server without device conflict and \
        lessen setup and maintenance on a project.

        - borrowing an available device from the devicepool and returning it.
        - retrieving a device from the devicepool by `deviceId`

        ``KiticaLibrary`` is part of the ``kitica`` project and is built to
        provide support devicepool setup for running tests in RobotFramework
        setup.

        ``kitica`` is a devicepool project written in Python that provides
        RESTful API service, Host Client Listener for both iOS and Android
        and aims to support local device farm setups.

    You can import this library in your robot test suite by using the   \
        syntax below.
    For the parameters on import. Read `Importing`.

    *Example:*
    | =Settings= | =Value=         | =Parameter=                        |
    | Library    | UserpoolLibrary | http://kitica.dev                  |

    `Borrow Device`, `Borrow Android Device` and `Borrow iOS Device`    \
    returns a json object containing the following information:

    *JSON Representation:*

    |     "deviceId": 1,
    |     "deviceName": "Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra",
    |     "platformName": "Android",

    See `Borrowed Device Object Values` for the values decription.

    = Borrowed Device Object Values =

    == deviceId ==
    The unique integer value that is tagged to a specific device, could be used
    as parameter in `Borrow Device` Keyword to target a specific device.

    Could be used together with the `forced` argument to force the service to
    provide the device even when the device's ``status`` is ``ACTIVE``
    but not ``UNPLUGGED``.

    == deviceName ==
    The name of the device borrowed. When Running Appium XCUITEST in real iOS
    devices, this value is required.

    == platformName ==
    Denotes the platform of the device, should only be either ``Android``
    or ``iOS``.

    == server ==
    The device farm host the returned device is connected to.

    == port ==
    The Appium Port that is tagged to the device.

    == udid ==
    The device's unique Identification, at least for real devices, for AVD
    emulated devices uses the pattern ``emulator-xxxx`` as its `udid` value.

    == platformVersion ==
    The version of the platform of the borrowed device.

    == status ==
    Denotes the status of the device returned by the kitica API service.

    == teamName ==
    The team owner of the device, will be bypassed when `Borrow Device` is
    provided by ``forced==true`` and ``deviceId`` parameter.

    == version ==
    iterates whenever the device field is updated.

    == borrowerIp ==
    Stores the value of the latest borrower of the device.

    == borrowerHostname ==
    Stores the hostname of the latest borrower of the device.

    == lastBorrowed ==
    Logs the date and time the device was last borrowed.

    == deviceType ==
    Indicates whether the returned device is either a `Real Device` or an
    `Emulator`.

    == driverpath ==
    The resolvable PATH of the device host server the device is connected to.

        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | platformName=Android          |
        Both example will produce the same result since ``platformName``
        will default to ``Android`` when no value is provided.

        === Borrowing an iOS Device ===
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | platformName=iOS              |
        Note that ``iOS`` parameter is case sensitive.

        === Borrowing Device with specific platformVersion ===
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | platformName=Android  \
                                            | platformVersion=9     |
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | platformVersion=iOS   \
                                            | platformVersion=13.3  |
        When ``platformVersion`` is omitted as an argument, the service will
        try to search for the specific version, but, if no device with such
        version is found, kitica API will return None.

        === Borrowing a Device using deviceId ===
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | deviceId=1            |
        The service will return the specific device if and only if the
        specified device's status is ``FREE``. Will raise a
        ``DeviceBorrowError`` if the device specified is ``ACTIVE`` or
        ``UNPLUGGED``.

        === NOTE ===
         - When ``deviceId`` is provided all other arguments provided is\
         ignored except for ``forced``.

        === Borrowing a device using deviceID with forced set to True ===
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | deviceID=1            \
                                            | forced=True           |
        When borrowing a device with forced set to ``True``, the service will
        return the specified device even when it's current status is
        ``ACTIVE``, but not when it is ``UNPLUGGED``.

        ``forced`` is only implemented when ``deviceId`` is specified and will
        be ignored when ``deviceId`` is not provided.
