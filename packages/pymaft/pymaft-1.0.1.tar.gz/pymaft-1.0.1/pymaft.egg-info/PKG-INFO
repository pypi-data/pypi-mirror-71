Description: PyMAFT is a numerical library for simulations of Models of Active Field Theories in Python.                      It constructs differentiation matrices using finite-difference and spectral methods.                       It also allows to solve Stokes equation using a spectral method, which satisfies compressibility exactly.                        The library currently offers support for doing field theoretical simulation and a direct numerical simulation of the Stokes equation                        in both two and three space
