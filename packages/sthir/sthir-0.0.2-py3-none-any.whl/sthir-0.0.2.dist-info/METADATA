**Sthir** can create *memory efficient* search feature for your static website. Sthir is equipped with an *user friendly command-line interface*. In two steps you can build a working search page for your website!

## Description
Sthir is a library to create search functionality for your static websites. It scans your `html` pages for words and indexes these words in an efficient data structure called **Spectral Bloom Filters**. Spectral Bloom Filteres differs from regular ones as they can store counts for each hash (it can estimate, at minimum, how many times a hash was indexed). We are using an efficient base 15 decoding to compress and transfer the bloom filters at client side. Our goal can be described with a simple equation:

`Less Memory Footprint + Term Frequency Knowledge = Perfect Search Functionality for Static Sites!`

## Installation

sthir runs on Python 3.5 or above.

Installation with pip via PyPI for OS X , Linux and Windows:
```sh
pip install sthir
```
To check installation run the following command:
```sh
sthir -h
```
If you see the help messages without any error then the installation was successful.
