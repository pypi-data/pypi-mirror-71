Description: # cpytraceafl-regex
        
        This is a thinly modified version of Matthew Barnett's
        [mrab-regex](https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex) regular expression library with
        added instrumentation for use when fuzzing python code with
        [cpytraceafl](https://github.com/risicle/cpytraceafl).
        
        The intention is for fuzzing harnesses to be able to substitute the builtin `re` module
        library with this, highly compatible, module and thereby allow AFL to generate examples
        which pass regular expressions used in the target or explore their limits in interesting
        ways.
        
        See the original [README.mrab-regex.rst](./README.mrab-regex.rst) for more general
        information in this library's extended regex features.
        
        ## Recommended usage
        
        Early in the startup of the fuzzing harness, (though after the call to `install_rewriter()`):
        
        ```python
        import regex
        from sys import modules
        modules["re"] = regex
        ```
        
        code later importing/referencing the `re` module should instead be using this instrumented
        `regex` code. Note that before evaluating any regexes, `cpytraceafl.tracehook.set_map_start()`
        will need to have been initialized with a memory region to write its intrumentation data
        into. Otherwise you'll get segfaults.
