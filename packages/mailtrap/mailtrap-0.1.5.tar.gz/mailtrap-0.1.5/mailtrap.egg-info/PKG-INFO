        MailTrap is a SMTP server designed to run in your dev/test environment, that is designed to catch any email you or your application is sending, and display it in a web interface instead if sending to real world. It help you prevents sending any dev/test emails to real people, no matter what address you provide.
        Just point your app/email client to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 and look at your emails on http://127.0.0.1/1080.
        
        MailTrap is built on shoulders of:
        * [MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) - original idea comes of this tool by Samuel Cochran.
        * [MailDump](https://github.com/ThiefMaster/maildump) - base source code of `MailTrap`, by Adrian Mönnich.
