Changelog
=========

1.10.12 (2020-06-16)
--------------------

- Fix brown bag release: fully pinned versions in setup.py means we're juggling
  with the specific versions we have available on the platform.


1.10.11 (2020-06-16)
--------------------

- Use the `mgm` VLAN as the canonical name for nodes that do not have an
  `srv VLAN (but always prefer SRV). This allows addressing switches and
  similar devices in the infrastructure more easily.


1.10.10 (2019-11-12)
--------------------

- Remove maintenance flag in directory if maintenance prepare scripts fail. This
  reduces changes for VM migration deadlock (#120249).


1.10.9 (2019-09-24)
-------------------

- Migrate project repository to Github.

- Fix parsing Qemu image sizes after Qemu upgrade, add test coverage. (#119236)


1.10.8 (2019-04-17)
-------------------

- Stop making backups for VMs in soft deletion stage. (#27020, #22345)


1.10.7 (2019-03-01)
-------------------

- Fix broken tests.

- Fix DNS updates when no reverse Zone exists (#107874).

- Fix disk resize for root partitions starting at sector 16384 (#108528).


1.10.6 (2018-11-30)
-------------------

- Additional logging in resize2fs (#107265).


1.10.5 (2018-10-22)
-------------------

- Adapt VM base image loading code to Ceph Jewel.

- Fix VM base image loading for Hydra static channel compatibility.


1.10.4 (2018-10-19)
-------------------

- Additional safeguards for filesystem resize (#106759).


1.10.3 (2018-10-10)
-------------------

- Fix bug in filesystem resize code (#105199).


1.10.2 (2018-09-27)
-------------------

- Ignore errors while purging old backup directories (#106478).


1.10.1 (2018-04-10)
-------------------

- Allow local include files for DHCP configuration, e.g.,
  `/etc/dhcp/local/dhcpd6.srv.in` (#100669).


1.10.0 (2018-04-04)
-------------------

- VM image charging: use LZ4 compressed images.


1.9.13 (2017-08-01)
-------------------

- Update hostmaster address (#16370).
- Stabilize DNS record sort order (#16370).


1.9.12 (2017-06-12)
-------------------

- Also configure output RG firewall rules to relieve conntrack table overload.


1.9.11 (2017-05-24)
-------------------

- Make vmimage download code more robust if encountering a 404. Hydra doesn't
  necessarily always provide an image and we're fine with that. We just keep
  using an older version that is still good (#26700).


1.9.10 (2017-03-09)
-------------------

- Fix VM Ceph image deletion. This was forgotten to be updated when we moved
  from RG-specific pools to pools that reflect the underlying storage
  technology. The new code hunts down all images of a VM, potentially in all
  pools.


1.9.9 (2016-12-21)
------------------

- Improve resource usage of VM config scrubbing: we did not limit the number
  of subprocess of "fc-qemu ensure" that we were spawning.

  We only limited the rate of spawns per second. At some points we saw VM
  servers to get overloaded by a) using multiprocessing.Process that creates
  superfluous forks and b) when the host was busy the actual fc.qemu
  subprocesses where spawned faster than the host could work on them. That lead
  to a very "interesting" behaviour of memory usage where suddenly a lot of
  processes were pushed into swap.

  We now a) do not create superfluous forks and b) limit to at most 5 fc.qemu
  instances at a time.


1.9.8 (2016-12-15)
------------------

- Fix locking error in VM charging (#25145).


1.9.7 (2016-11-17)
------------------

- Bugfix: log stdout/stderr of prepare/finish scripts.


1.9.6 (2016-10-31)
------------------

- Read global backy.conf parameters from `/etc/backy.global.conf`. Fall back to
  built-in defaults if this file does not exist.


1.9.5 (2016-10-21)
------------------

- Drop the invocation of fc-qemu using the config file and use the VM name
  instead. (Requires fc-qemu 0.8.2)

- Always make pending requests unique based on their comment.
  When a request with an identical comment is registered we update the parameters, though.

1.9.4 (2016-06-20)
------------------

- New backup schedule "default-full". #21960


1.9.3 (2016-05-04)
------------------

- Fix bug in VM image charging. Also reduce cluster load while charging. #21393


1.9.2 (2016-04-07)
------------------

- Create symlinks for users boxes which use autofs. Needs at least fc.platform
  commit:11f2052bd606 (#19668).


1.9.1 (2016-03-20)
------------------

- Switch to explicit RBD pool selection instead of RG-based derivation. #20692


1.9.0 (2016-03-03)
------------------

- Nagios: Configure a separate system contact group for each RG and put
  only users with the wheel permission in (#20445).


1.8.3 (2016-03-01)
------------------

- Don't fail to schedule maintenance if estimate is a float (#20326)


1.8.2 (2016-02-19)
------------------

- Reliably remove users from VMs (#20092)

- Move nagios consistency check to fc.platform (#19851)

1.8.1 (2016-01-20)
------------------

- Minor output improvement on VM image update script.


1.8 (2016-01-20)
----------------

- Introduce base image management: clone VM images for our branches
  (dev, staging, production) into Ceph's 'rbd' pool to use for cloning
  new VMs.


1.7.10 (2015-12-18)
-------------------

- Improve directory/nagios consistency check (#19425).

1.7.9 (2015-12-09)
------------------

- Increase Ceph GiB/PG ratio to 16 (#18803).
- Don't count snapshots for GiB/PG ratio calculation (#18803).


1.7.8 (2015-11-25)
------------------

- Ceph RBD volumes are now deleted when a VM enters 'hard' deletion state
  (#19129).
- Fold `localconfig-ceph-pools` and `localconfig-ceph-purge-volumes` into
  `localconfig-ceph-volumes` (#19129).
- Reenable check_nagios_directory_sync (#18598).


1.7.6 (2015-11-11)
------------------

- Improve handling of deleted VMs in both bacula and backy configuration scripts
  (#13456)
- Add check for incompletely bootstrapped VMs (#18600)


1.7.5 (2015-11-06)
------------------

- Omit deleted nodes from generated backy configuration (#13456).
- Include explicit values for pool and image in generated backy configuration
  (#13456).


1.7.4 (2015-10-30)
------------------

- backy config: generate valid config file even when there are no jobs present
  (#13456).
- Generalize bacula purge code, rename localconfig-bacula-purge-stamps to
  localconfig-bacula-purge (#13456).


1.7.3 (2015-09-21)
------------------

- localconfig-backy writes backy.conf from directory ENC data (#13456).


1.7.2 (2015-07-30)
------------------

- Delete unused pools (no RG or RG contains no VMs) (#14997).


1.7.1 (2015-07-22)
------------------

- Mark maintenance jobs as SUCCESS (but don't run the script) is `applicable`
  returns with exit code 1 (#16413).

- Fix bug which could leave pgp_num permanntly lower than pg_num (#16711).

- Refactor maintenance: introduce global prepare/finish scripts that
  can be run when maintenance starts or finishes. This allows evacuating
  KVM hosts or outmigrating Ceph OSDs before starting maintenance,
  rebooting, etc. This decouples the jobs' awareness of its environment -
  maitenance jobs can expect that a machine may get interrupted. The prepare
  and finish scripts are required to be careful to stop maintenance and
  put things back in order when maintenance is finished (#13755).

- Protect against users re-registering local Unix usernames (like root, apache,
  or others) without us noticing. Currently you could still register them but
  things would break on your machines anyway.


1.7.0 (2015-07-01)
------------------

- Automatic Kibana configuration (#16002).
- Parallelize localconfig-kvm-init (#14920).


1.6.8 (2015-06-03)
------------------

- Implement late autosigning when VMs are brought up with race conditions.


1.6.7 (2015-06-02)
------------------

- Delete non-existent Ceph pools if they contain no images (#14997).
- Remove now outdated Qemu/KVM management code as this has all moved
  to fc.qemu.

1.6.6 (2015-04-10)
------------------

- Remove explicit nagios notification for technical contacts. (#14900)
- Fix spurious bug in update-iptables invocation.


1.6.5 (2015-03-20)
------------------

- Ignore missing pools when deleting volumes. (#14947)


1.6.4 (2015-03-13)
------------------

- Improve node deletion: delete snapshots of VM images, too. (#14894)


1.6.3 (2015-03-05)
------------------

- Improve node deletion: delete bacula config snippets, too.


1.6.2 (2015-03-02)
------------------

- Add "postpone" maintenance script status (#13755).
- Remove obsolete "redundancy_groups" action.


1.6.1 (2015-02-09)
------------------

- Fix bug for puppet master deactivation.


1.6 (2015-02-05)
----------------

- Use new deletions API to clean up VM data on puppetmaster, KVM hosts,
  Ceph, Bacula, and Nagios.

- Fix bogus ProcessLookupError except clause.


1.5.4 (2014-12-12)
------------------

- Fix bug which caused disk grow to fail during the first attempt (#13930).
- Improve iptables reloading (#13879).


1.5.3 (2014-11-22)
------------------

- Refactored resize2fs disk grow code (#13414).
- Delete expired snapshots which adhere to the '*-keep-until-*' naming
  convention (#13414).
- Remove old KVM configure code. The code lives now in the fc.qemu package
  (#13414).


1.5.2 (2014-10-01)
------------------

- Revive localconfig-resize2fs-root: this is not obsolete but necessary for
  disk grow.

- Exclude users from duplicate contact detection in case they have no email
  address.


1.5.1 (2014-10-01)
------------------

- Ensure we do not block restarts of VMs when the directory is not up.

- Ensure we screen directory exceptions when generating Nagios contacts.

- Remove old, unused, and broken KVM entry points.

- Avoid duplicates when creating technical contacts. (#13629)

- Explain how to run tests in HACKING.txt.


1.5.0 (2014-09-13)
------------------

- Integate new fc.qemu package instead of instrumenting a complicated
  init script.

- Restart firewall in case of changed config files.


1.4.1 (2014-09-09)
------------------

- Let Nagios configure contacts for technical contacts of resource groups, too.


1.4.0 (2014-08-22)
------------------

- Clean outdated RBD snapshots (#13414).


1.3.6 (2014-08-21)
------------------

- Bugfix: the actual config file we pass to qemu is the shell-expanded one in
  /run/kvm.*.cfg. The last refactoring accidentally pointed it to the template
  in /etc/kvm/.


1.3.5 (2014-08-21)
------------------

* Do not try to inmigrate VMs that should be running and *are* running already.

* Adapt test setup to py.test after moving to separate repository and
  get all tests green.

* Extract computation of tmp and swap volumes from init script so we can test
  them and make them more robust for migration.
