# Flexibox

![Flexibox logo](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49996933693_2d253b2b0d_o.png)

**Flexibox** is the a selenium wrapper for all **browsers** and **browser** **configurations**. This module is a single end point to access all the browser drivers and as well as the webdriver object for all the respective browsers along with the installation of your **selenium** module.

## Problem Statement
With the very fast pace of development, it has now become very important to have regular release cycle and with it it should be also kept in mind that we do a quality release. For this reason we have to have our tests automated as well so that we can have a centralised reports for regressions and other flaws in the system at the end of each build.

Now, for a stable build we have to check that our application is compatible with different browsers and platforms. When we start implementing a framework based out of Selenium WebDriver, for the code to get executed in different browsers we have to configure each of the browsers separately and make a call to the browser based on the requirement. Phewww !! That is some good amount of code written.

## The Idea
The problem statement that has been defined above was the reason I took out time to ease this entire process of setting up the browser drivers and the respective configurations for each browser. What if this process can be reduced down into few steps of execution? That is how I ended up with the idea and the implementation of **Flexibox**.

## Features covered up by 'Flexibox'
*   One step to **download** the required browser drivers.
*   One step to **update** the required browser drivers.
*   Create a **single** **instance** for your required browser object. No more code required to configure your browsers separately.
*   A set of browser related **generic** **functions** that can be utilised for debugging as well as for achieving the required functionalities. So, we are reducing quite an effort over here as well !!
*   You can run browsers **Chrome** and **Firefox** using the **headless** option as well so that it is comfortable running your framework on the server as well.

## Flexibox by functionality
![functionality screenshot](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1750/41853754714_971a727962.jpg)

There are two ways in which you can use Flexibox.

*   Download the required browser driver, create instance for the specific browser driver class.
*   Download the required browser driver, create instance for the specific browser driver class, create instance for the browser controller class and use the generic functions to get started with your framework.

You can refer to the above diagram for reference.

## Installing and Updating driver packages

### Install Flexibox module
*   To install Flexibox using PiP run the command:

	   `pip install flexibox`

## Get started with Flexibox
### Browser Controller class by functionality
The `Browser Controller` class provides you with some eccentric methods that can be utilised to achieve the required functions.

*      get_url(driver, url): request the required url entered. Pass the required driver object and the 'url' as parameters.

*      implicit_wait_time(driver, time): Apply implicit wait before the dom loads. Pass the required driver object and the time as parameters.

*      set_window_size(driver, height, width): Set the window size for the current running browser. Pass the required driver object, height and the width of the window.

*      get_current_url(driver): Get the current url. Pass the required driver object as parameter.

*      get_network_requests(driver): Get all the network requests for the current page. Pass the required driver object as parameter.

*      performance_metrics(driver): Get required page performance data. Pass the required driver object as parameter.

*      check_console_logs(driver): Get all console logs. Pass the required driver object as parameter.

*      get_page_source(driver): Get the current page source. Pass the required driver object as parameter.

*      get_site_cookies(driver): Get all the site cookies. Pass the required driver object as parameter.

### Create instance for Chrome
*      Create instance for the `ChromeDriverObject` class
*      Use the instance for `ChromeDriverObject` class to call the `set_chromedriver_object` method.
*      Create instance for the `Browser_controller` class to use the generic methods.

```python
	from flexibox.generic_functions.chrome_object import ChromeDriverObject
	from flexibox.generic_functions.browser_controller import Browser_controller
	from time import sleep

	class Test_1():
		def test_chromedriver_type1(self):
			chromedriver = ChromeDriverObject()
			controller = Browser_controller()
			driver = chromedriver.set_chromedriver_object()
			controller.get_url(driver, "https://www.google.co.in")
			controller.implicit_wait_time(driver, 4)
			current_url = controller.get_current_url(driver)
			print current_url
```
*      To run chromedriver using the `headless` feature you have to pass the argument '--headless' in the `set_chromedriver_object()` method

```python
	from flexibox.generic_functions.chrome_object import ChromeDriverObject
	from flexibox.generic_functions.browser_controller import Browser_controller
	class Test_1():
		def test_chromedriver_type1(self):
			chromedriver = ChromeDriverObject()
			controller = Browser_controller()
			driver = chromedriver.set_chromedriver_object('--headless')
			controller.get_url(driver, "https://www.google.co.in")
			controller.implicit_wait_time(driver, 4)
			current_url = controller.get_current_url(driver)
			print current_url
```

### Create instance for Firefox
*   Create instance for the `GeckoDriverObject` class
*   Use the instance for `GeckoDriverObject` class to call the `set_geckodriver_object` method.
*   Create instance for the `Browser_controller` class to use the generic methods.

```python
	from flexibox.generic_functions.gecko_object import GeckoDriverObject
	from flexibox.generic_functions.browser_controller import Browser_controller
	class Test1():
		def test_geckodriver_type1(self):
			geckodriver = GeckoDriverObject()
			controller = Browser_controller()
			driver = geckodriver.set_geckodriver_object()
			controller.implicit_wait_time(driver, 4)
			controller.get_url(driver, "https://www.google.co.in")
			current_url = controller.get_current_url(driver)
			print current_url
			print driver.title
```
*  To run geckodriver using the `headless` feature you have to pass the argument '--headless' in the `set_geckodriver_object()` method

```python
	from flexibox.generic_functions.gecko_object import GeckoDriverObject
	from flexibox.generic_functions.browser_controller import Browser_controller
	class Test1():
		def test_geckodriver_type1(self):
			geckodriver = GeckoDriverObject()
			controller = Browser_controller()
			driver = geckodriver.set_geckodriver_object('--headless')
			controller.implicit_wait_time(driver, 4)
			controller.get_url(driver, "https://www.google.co.in")
			current_url = controller.get_current_url(driver)
			print current_url
			print driver.title
```

### Create instance for Opera

		def test_operadriver_type1(self):
			operadriver = OperaDriverObject()
			controller = Browser_controller()
			driver = operadriver.set_operadriver_object()
			controller.implicit_wait_time(driver, 4)
			controller.get_url(driver, "https://www.google.co.in")
			current_url = controller.get_current_url(driver)
			print current_url
			print driver.title
```

### Create instance for Safari

*   Use the instance for `SafariDriverObject` class to call the `set_safaridriver_object` method
*   Create instance for the `Browser_controller` class to use the generic methods.

```python
	from flexibox.generic_functions.safari_object import SafariDriverObject
	from flexibox.generic_functions.browser_controller import Browser_controller
	class Test_1():
		def test_safaridriver_type1(self):
			safaridriver = SafariDriverObject()
