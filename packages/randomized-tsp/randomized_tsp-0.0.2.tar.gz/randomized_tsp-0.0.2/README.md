# randomized_tsp

A python3 package implementing randomized algorithms for [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
The implementations are based off of [A first course in Artificial Intelligence: Deepak Khemani](https://www.mheducation.co.in/a-first-course-in-artificial-intelligence-9781259029981-india).

The algorithms implemented include:
- [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
- [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)
- [Ant Colony Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms)

## Installation

You can install this using `pip`. Just run

``pip install randomized_tsp``

## Usage

See [example](example/) here.

If you have `n` cities in your problem then you need to define the distances between cities using a two dimensional `n X n` list.
`distances[i][j]` should give the distance between city i and city j.

```python
from randomized_tsp.tsp import tsp

# If you have 3 cities then you need to define this list 
# which gives the distances between two cities
distances = [[0, 4, 2], [4, 0, 3], [2, 3, 0]]

tsp_obj = tsp(distances)

# To run genetic algorithm
tour, cost = tsp_obj.genetic_algorithm()

# To run simulated annealing
tour, cost = tsp_obj.simulated_annealing()

# To run ant colony optimization
tour, cost = tsp_obj.ant_colony()
```

All the three algorithms return that best tour found and the cost of that tour. Tour is represented using path representation.

Some optional parameters are also available for the above algorithms.

                      population_size=50,
                      mutation_prob=0.1,
                      crossover='order'):

        :param mutation_prob:   Probability that a offspring will mutate
        :param crossover:       Defines the crossover operator, currently two options are available
                                `order` and `cycle`.
        :return:                Returns the best tour found and the cost of that tour
                                A tour is represented using path representation

               num_of_ants=20,
               pheromone_evapouration=0.2):
        """
        :param num_of_ants:            Number of ants in the colony
        :param pheromone_evapouration: Evapouration rate of the pheromone deposited by ants
        :return:                       Returns the best tour found and the cost of that tour
                                       A tour is represented using path representation
        """
