        |dob|_ is an interactive, terminal-based time tracking application.
        
        You'll find Vim-like navigation,
        robust functionality,
        a customizable user experience,
        lots of great plugins, and
        an elegant, minimalistic interface.
        
        ``dob`` is written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__
        and installs easily with |pip|_:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ pip3 install dob
        
        The best way to learn ``dob`` is to run the demo:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ dob demo
        
        For other setup options, read the |install-guide|_.
        
        - Hint: You might need to |update-path|_.

        dob has lots of CLI commands, and it also includes an interactive terminal application.
        
        Here's a little taste of what the terminal application looks like.::

        ``dob`` is released to |beta|_!
        
        * You can |demo-dob|_ to see how awesome it is!
        
        * You can also start using ``dob``!
        
          But just be aware that it has not been vetted yet for a larger
          audience — you might still encounter a few issues. But please
          report them, and we'll get them fixed.
        
          We just don't want you to have a bad first experience.
        
          Aka, *you've been warned!*
        
          (Nonetheless, the ``dob`` beta uses a backup file judiciously,
          so if it does crash, you should not lose any unsaved data.)
        
        dob is already feature-rich, and it's used daily (hourly!) by
        the authors.
        
        To see what all the fuss is about, you can ``pip3 install dob``
        and run ``dob demo`` right now to try it out.
        
        Or, keep reading for an overview of dob, a list of its features,
        and then detailed documentation of the interactive editor commands.
        
        OS Support
        ==========
        
        ``dob`` runs on any operating system that supports Python,
        including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
        
        Please see the |install-guide|_ for help getting setup.
        
        ###########
        Quick Start
        ###########
        
        If you want to dive right in (after running the demo to get acquainted), try::
        
           $ dob init
           $ dob edit
        
        The ``init`` command creates a config file and the database,
        and the ``edit`` command runs the interactive editor.
        
        You can also run ``dob --help`` to see an overview of all commands.
        
        #####
        Ethos
        #####
        
        ``dob`` is a designed for developers, but suitable
        for any individual whose comfortable in the terminal.
        
        ``dob`` is perfect for the person who asks,
        *Why must I use my mouse to manage time tracking?*
        
        ``dob`` is even more suited for the person who asks,
        *How can I manage time tracking with the fewest possible keystrokes?*
        
        ``dob`` is inspired by
        `Hamster <https://github.com/projecthamster/>`__,
        a beloved but aged time tracking application for
        `GNOME <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME>`__.
        
        ``dob`` is emulative of `Vim <https://www.vim.org/>`__,
        an editor that enables users to concentrate on their
        work while the tool itself slips into the background.
        
        Try ``dob`` today -- you might like it!
        
        - `Demo dob`_ to learn it.
        
        - | Then, `start from scratch`__,
          | or `load a legacy database`__.

        Plugins
        #######
        
        Plugins make it easy for everyday dobbers to write their own
        features and to share them with the broader community.
        
        The core development team has created the following plugins
        for non-essential and distribution-specific features.
        
        *Please note: these plugins are not yet published!*
        (We just want to get you excited in the meantime.)
        
        - The ``dob-plugin-export-commit``
          plugin exports and commits changes to your dob database on every save.
        
        - The ``dob-plugin-stale-fact-goader``
          plugin displays a GNOME-style popup notification after some amount of
          inactivity to badger you to start a new Fact.
        
        - The ``dob-plugin-git-hip``
          plugin tags the active Fact based on the Git branch name
          pulled from the current directory.
        
        Have a great idea for ``dob``? Implement it as a plugin!
        
        - Plugins have complete access to dob.
        
          Plugins can add their own commands.
        
          Plugins can add their own configuration.
        
          Plugins can run on startup, on exit, or whenever the user saves.
        
        Plugins help keep ``dob`` lean, and they let you turn
        an idea into a feature quickly and easily!
        
        #######
        Thanks!
        #######
        
        We hope you enjoy using dob as much as we have had making it!
        
        And if you like it, please tell your friends and colleagues about it.
        Tell the whole world!!
        
        Keep on dobbin'!
