    Start or add a fact.

    Args:
        factoid (str): ``factoid`` detailing Fact to be added.
            See elsewhere for the factoid format.

        time_hint (str, optional): One of:
            | 'verify_none': Do not expect to find any time encoded in factoid.
            | 'verify_both': Expect to find both start and end times.
            | 'verify_start': Expect to find just one time, which is the start.
            | 'verify_end': Expect to find just one time, which is the end.
            | 'verify_then': Optional time is new start; and either extend
            ongoing fact to new start, or back-fill interval gap.
            | 'verify_still': Optional time is new start; copy prev meta to new Fact;
            either extend ongoing fact, or back-fill interval gap.
            | 'verify_after': No time spec. Start new Fact at time of previous end.

        yes (bool, optional): If True, update other Facts changed by the new
            fact being added (affects other Facts' start/end/deleted attrs).
            If False, prompt user (i.e., using fancy interface built with
            python-prompt-toolkit) for each conflict.

        edit_meta (bool, optional): If True, prompt user for activity and/or
            category, if not indicated; and prompt user for tags. Shows
            MRU lists to try to make it easy for user to specify commonly
            used items.

    Returns:
        Nothing: If everything went alright. (Otherwise, will have exited.)
