# The following requirement is here because botocore restricts the version of python-dateutil (see
# https://github.com/boto/botocore/commit/e87e7a745fd972815b235a9ee685232745aa94f9).  Since pip is
# not a full dependency solver, it has already installed python-dateutil before botocore is
# installed, and bombs after the fact.
