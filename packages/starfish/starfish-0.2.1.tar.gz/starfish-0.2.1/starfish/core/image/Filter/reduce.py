class Reduce(FilterAlgorithm):
    """
    Reduces the cardinality of one or more axes to 1 by applying a function across those axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dims : Iterable[Union[Axes, str]]
        one or more Axes to reduce over
    func : Union[str, FunctionSourceBundle]
        Function to apply across the dimension(s) specified by ``dims``.

        If this value is a string, then the ``module`` parameter is consulted to determine which
        python package is used to find the function.  If ``module`` is not specified, then the
        default is :py:attr:`FunctionSource.np`.

        If this value is a ``FunctionSourceBundle``, then the python package and module name is
        obtained from the bundle.

        Some common examples for the np FunctionSource:

        - amax: maximum intensity projection (applies np.amax)
        - max: maximum intensity projection (this is an alias for amax and applies np.amax)
        - mean: take the mean across the dim(s) (applies np.mean)
        - sum: sum across the dim(s) (applies np.sum)
    module : Optional[FunctionSource]
        Python module that serves as the source of the function.  It must be listed as one of the
        members of :py:class:`FunctionSource`.

        Currently, the supported FunctionSources are:
        - ``np``: the top-level package of numpy
        - ``scipy``: the top-level package of scipy

        This is being deprecated in favor of specifying the function as a ``FunctionSourceBundle``.
    clip_method : Optional[Union[str, :py:class:`~starfish.types.Clip`]]
        Deprecated method to control the way that data are scaled to retain skimage dtype
        requirements that float data fall in [0, 1].  In all modes, data below 0 are set to 0.

        - Clip.CLIP: data above 1 are set to 1.  This has been replaced with
          level_method=Levels.CLIP.
        - Clip.SCALE_BY_IMAGE: when any data in the entire ImageStack is greater than 1, the entire
          ImageStack is scaled by the maximum value in the ImageStack.  This has been replaced with
          level_method=Levels.SCALE_SATURATED_BY_IMAGE.
        - Clip.SCALE_BY_CHUNK: when any data in any slice is greater than 1, each slice is scaled by
          the maximum value found in that slice.  The slice shapes are determined by the
          ``group_by`` parameters.  This has been replaced with
          level_method=Levels.SCALE_SATURATED_BY_CHUNK.
    level_method : :py:class:`~starfish.types.Levels`
        Controls the way that data are scaled to retain skimage dtype requirements that float data
        fall in [0, 1].  In all modes, data below 0 are set to 0.

        - Levels.CLIP (default): data above 1 are set to 1.
        - Levels.SCALE_SATURATED_BY_IMAGE: when any data in the entire ImageStack is greater
          than 1, the entire ImageStack is scaled by the maximum value in the ImageStack.
        - Levels.SCALE_SATURATED_BY_CHUNK: when any data in any slice is greater than 1, each
          slice is scaled by the maximum value found in that slice.  The slice shapes are
          determined by the ``group_by`` parameters.
        - Levels.SCALE_BY_IMAGE: scale the entire ImageStack by the maximum value in the
          ImageStack.
        - Levels.SCALE_BY_CHUNK: scale each slice by the maximum value found in that slice.  The
          slice shapes are determined by the ``group_by`` parameters.

    Examples
    --------
    Reducing via max projection.
        >>> from starfish.core.imagestack.test.factories.synthetic_stack import synthetic_stack
        >>> from starfish.image import Filter
        >>> from starfish.types import Axes
        >>> stack = synthetic_stack()
        >>> reducer = Filter.Reduce({Axes.ROUND}, func="max")
        >>> max_proj = reducer.run(stack)

    Reducing via linalg.norm
        >>> from starfish.core.imagestack.test.factories.synthetic_stack import synthetic_stack
        >>> from starfish.image import Filter
        >>> from starfish.types import Axes, FunctionSource
        >>> stack = synthetic_stack()
        >>> reducer = Filter.Reduce(
                {Axes.ROUND},
                func=FunctionSource.scipy("linalg.norm"),
                ord=2,
            )
