# planutils

General library for setting up linux-based environments for developing, running, and evaluating planners.

## Usage

This doesn't work yet, but gives a general sense of where the project may be headed.

### Docker

The included Docker file will come with planutils pre-installed. Note that in order to
run a number of the planners (all those that are based on singularity), you will need
to run the docker with the `--privileged` option.
