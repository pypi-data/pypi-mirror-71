Description: # planutils
        
        General library for setting up linux-based environments for developing, running, and evaluating planners.
        
        ## Usage
        
        This doesn't work yet, but gives a general sense of where the project may be headed.
        
        ```bash
        $ planutils --install-planners ipc-2018
        This will require 3Gb of storage. Proceed? [Y/n]
        Fetching all of the planners from IPC-2018 for use on the command line...
        
        $ planutils --setup-server-environment
        Setting up a webserver to call the installed planners...
        
        $ planutils --setup-development-environment

        ```
        
        ### Docker
        
        The included Docker file will come with planutils pre-installed. Note that in order to
        run a number of the planners (all those that are based on singularity), you will need
        to run the docker with the `--privileged` option.
