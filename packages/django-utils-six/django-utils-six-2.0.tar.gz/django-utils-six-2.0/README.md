# django-utils-six

Forward compatibility django.utils.six for Django 3

```bash
pip install Django>3
pip install django-utils-six
```

Code is taken from [Django 2.2](https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.2.x/django/utils/six.py)

## Why?

I found `django.utils.six` is solely responsible for plenty of libraries' incompatibility with Django 3.
