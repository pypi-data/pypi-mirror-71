Backups
=======

Persistent data is placed in :ref:`encrypted volumes
<attached_volumes>` otherwise it may be deleted at any moment, when
the host fails. A daily backup of all volumes is done by the host in
the `backup-service-group` group. Exactly one host must be set in the
`~/.enough/example.com/inventory/services.yml` file, like so:

.. code:: yaml

    backup-service-group:
      hosts:
        bind-host:

The number of backups is defined with the `backup_retention_days` variable
as documented `in this file <https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/blob/master/playbooks/backup/roles/backup/defaults/main.yml>`__ and can be set in `~/.enough/example.com/inventory/group_vars/backup-service-group.yml` like so:

.. code:: yaml

    ---
    backup_retention_days: 7

.. note::

   If the quota for volume snapshots displayed by `enough --domain
   example.com quota show` is too low, a support ticket should be
   opened with the cloud provider to increase it.

A volume backup can be used to :ref:`restore a service
<restore_service_from_backup>` in the state it was at the time of the
backup.

The volumes are replicated three times and their data cannot be lost
because of a hardware failure.
