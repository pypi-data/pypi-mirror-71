Using Enough
============

Requirements
------------

Technical
~~~~~~~~~

* The ``openrc.sh`` credentials for a ``Public cloud`` project at `OVH
  <https://www.ovh.com/manager/public-cloud/>`__. No other OpenStack
  provider is supported.

* The ``Public cloud`` project has a `Private network
  <https://www.ovh.com/world/solutions/vrack/>`__.

Knowledge
~~~~~~~~~

Enough is based on `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`__, `OpenStack
<https://www.openstack.org/>`__ and `Debian GNU/Linux
<https://www.debian.org/>`__.  Debian GNU/Linux based virtual machines
are created on an OpenStack tenant and provisioned with Ansible
playbooks.

Each service adds more components such as `Let's encrypt
<https://letsencrypt.org/>`__, `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ or
`Snap <https://snapcraft.io/>`__. And they also implement concepts
such as `Virtual Private Network
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network>`__, `Reverse
Proxy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy>`__ or `Certificate
Authority <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority>`__.

If all goes well, Enough can be used even if the user knows nothing
more than what is in this guide. When something goes wrong, fixing the
problem or understanding the cause will require intimate knowledge
about all of the above. If that happens, it is best to start a
`discussion in the forum
<https://forum.enough.community/c/support/5>`__ and ask for help.

Installation
------------

* `Install Docker <http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`__.

* Copy ``openrc.sh`` in ``~/.enough/example.com/openrc.sh`` and edit
  to replace ``$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT`` with the actual password.

* Add the ``enough`` CLI to ``~/.bashrc``:

.. code::

     eval "$(docker run --rm enoughcommunity/enough:latest install)"

* Verify that it works:

.. code::

    enough --version

.. _bind_create:

Create the DNS name server
--------------------------

Assuming the domain name (``example.com`` for example) is registered,
it must be delegated to a dedicated name server before any service can
be created by Enough:

.. code::

     enough --domain example.com service create bind

.. note::
   Other hosts are created such as ``postfix-host`` or ``icinga-host`` because
   they are part of the core services that Enough needs. They however do not
   require manual intervention.

Upon successfull completion, a machine named ``bind-host`` exists and
its public IP must be used as a `GLUE record
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_record>`__.

.. code::

     $ enough --domain example.com openstack server list
     +---------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------+-----------+--------+
     | ID            | Name         | Status | Networks              | Image     | Flavor |
     +---------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------+-----------+--------+
     | e4f50405-f58b | icinga-host  | ACTIVE | Ext-Net=51.178.60.119 | Debian 10 | s1-2   |
     | 75610dd4-eba7 | postfix-host | ACTIVE | Ext-Net=51.178.60.120 | Debian 10 | s1-2   |
     | 2b9a1bda-c2c0 | bind-host    | ACTIVE | Ext-Net=51.178.60.121 | Debian 10 | s1-2   |
     +---------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------+-----------+--------+

To verify the DNS works as expected:

.. code::

     dig @ip-of-the-bind-host bind.example.com


It can then be used to instruct the `registrar
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar>`__ of
``example.com`` to delegate all domain name resolutions to this
IP. The exact method for performing this DNS delegation depends on the
registrar (`Gandi
<https://docs.gandi.net/en/domain_names/advanced_users/glue_records.html>`__
is different from `OVH
<https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/domains/glue_registry/>`__, etc.). But it needs
to be done only once.

.. note::
   It will take time for the delegation to be effective.
   Delays from 24h to 72h are not uncommon.

To verify the delegation is effective:

.. code::

     getent hosts bind.example.com


Create or update a service
--------------------------

The following services are available:

* :doc:`bind <services/bind>` for `DNS server <https://www.isc.org/bind/>`__ at ``bind.examples.com``
* :doc:`OpenVPN <services/VPN>`, for `VPN <https://openvpn.net/>`__ at ``openvpn.example.com``
* :doc:`chat <services/mattermost>`, for `instant messaging <https://mattermost.com/>`__ at ``chat.example.com``
* :doc:`cloud <services/nextcloud>`, for `file sharing <https://nextcloud.com/>`__ at ``cloud.example.com``
* ``forum``, for `discussions and mailing lists <https://www.discourse.org/>`__ at ``forum.example.com``
* ``packages``, a `static web service <https://www.nginx.com/>`__ at ``packages.example.com``
* ``pad``, for `collaborative note taking <https://etherpad.org/>`__ at ``pad.example.com``
* :doc:`weblate <services/weblate>`, for `online translations <https://weblate.org/>`__ at ``weblate.example.com``
* ``website``, for `static websites <https://gohugo.io/>`__ at ``website.example.com``
* ``wekan``, for `kanban <https://wekan.github.io/>`__ at ``wekan.example.com``
* :doc:`gitlab <services/gitlab>`, for `software development <https://gitlab.com/>`__ at ``lab.example.com``
* ``api``, for :doc:`Enough development <community/contribute>` at ``api.example.com``

As an example, the cloud service can be created as follows:

.. code::

     enough --domain example.com service create cloud

..  note::
    If the command fails, because of a network failure or any other reason,
    it is safe to run it again. It is idempotent.

When it completes successfully, it is possible to login
``https://cloud.example.com`` with user ``admin`` and password
``mynextcloud``.

Restore a service
-----------------

Stateless services such as :doc:`bind <services/bind>` do not need
backup: they can be rebuilt from scratch if the machine hosting them
fails. For instance, if `bind-host` is lost:

.. code::

   $ enough --domain example.com host create bind-host
   $ enough --domain example.com playbook

However, most services such as :doc:`file sharing <services/nextcloud>`
and :doc:`translations <services/weblate>` rely on persistent
information that are located in a encrypted volume attached to the
machine. A daily :doc:`backup <services/backup>` is made in case a
file is inadvertendly lost.

.. _restore_service_from_backup:

Restore a service from a backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore the volume attached to a service from a designated backup:

.. code::

   $ enough --domain example.com openstack volume snapshot list
   ...
   | 6b75f34e | 2020-04-12-cloud-volume | None | available | 100 |
   ...
   $ enough --domain example.com backup restore 2020-04-12-cloud-volume

In this example, the restoration is done as follows:

* The :doc:`cloud service <services/nextcloud>` is created, if it does not
  already exist.

* The machine (``cloud-host``) attached to the volume (``cloud-volume``) is
  stopped. The volume is detached and deleted.

* A new volume ``cloud-volume`` is created from the
  ``2020-04-12-cloud-volume`` backup and attached to ``cloud-host``.

* The machine (``cloud-host``) is restarted.


Create a clone of a service from a backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is convenient to create a clone of an existing service based on a
backup for:

* testing and experimenting without disrupting production
* verify an upgrade won't loose any data
* teaching
* etc.

Assuming the credentials for the OpenStack region on which the clone
must be placed are in the ``~/.enough/test-clouds.yml`` file:

.. code::

   $ enough --domain example.com openstack volume snapshot list
   ...
   | 6b75f34e | 2020-04-12-cloud-volume | None | available | 100 |
   ...
   $ enough --domain example.com backup restore \
            --target-domain test.d.enough.community \
            --target-clouds ~/.enough/test-clouds.yml 2020-04-12-cloud-volume

Once the service is cloned, it will be available at
``https://cloud.test.d.enough.community``. In this example, the
cloning is done as follows:

* A volume is created from the ``2020-04-12-cloud-volume``, in the
  ``~/.enough/test-clouds.yml`` OpenStack region.

* The :doc:`cloud service <services/nextcloud>` is created, as well as
  all the services it depends on, if they do not already
  exist. Including the :doc:`DNS server <services/bind>`.

* The ``test.d.enough.community`` domain is delegated to the
  :doc:`DNS server <services/bind>` located in the ``~/.enough/test-clouds.yml``
  OpenStack region so that ``https://cloud.test.d.enough.community`` resolves
  to the newly created :doc:`cloud service <services/nextcloud>`.

Infrastructure services and access
----------------------------------

Networks
~~~~~~~~

By default all hosts are connected to two networks: one with a public
IP and the other with a private IP. This can be changed by setting the
`openstack_network` variable in
`~/.enough/example.com/inventory/group_vars/all/network.yml`, using
`this example
<https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/blob/master/inventory/group_vars/all/network.yml>`__.

The default can also be changed for a given host (for instance
`weblate-host`) by setting the desired value in the
`~/.enough/example.com/inventory/host_vars/weblate-host/network.yml` file.


VPN
~~~

A VPN can optionally be installed for clients to access hosts that do
not have public IPs.

.. code::

     enough --domain example.com service create openvpn

The certificates for clients to connect to the VPN will be created
from the list in the `openvpn_active_clients` variable in
`~/.enough/example.com/inventory/group_vars/all/openvpn.yml`,
using `this example
<https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/blob/master/inventory/group_vars/all/openvpn.yml>`__.

For each name in the `openvpn_active_clients` list, a `.tar.gz` file will be created in the
`~/.enough/example.com/openvpn/` directory. For instance, for

.. code::

   ---
   openvpn_active_clients:
    - loic

The file `~/.enough/example.com/openvpn/loic.tar.gz` will be
created and contains OpenVPN credentials. The specific instructions
to use them depends on the client.

Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default certificates are obtained from `Let's Encrypt
<https://letsencrypt.org>`__. But if a host is not publicly
accessible, it can be configured to obtain a certificate from a
certificate authority dedicated to the Enough instance. The default
for `certificate_authority` should be set in
`~/.enough/example.com/inventory/group_vars/all/certificate.yml`, using `this example <https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/blob/master/inventory/group_vars/all/certificate.yml>`__.

The default can also be changed for a given host (for instance
`weblate-host`) by setting the desired value in the
`~/.enough/example.com/inventory/host_vars/weblate-host/network.yml` file.

.. _attached_volumes:

Attached volumes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provisioning
++++++++++++

A volume can be created and attached to the host. It can be resized at
a later time, when more space is needed. For instance, before creating
`weblate-host`, the desired volume size and name can be set in the
`~/.enough/example.com/inventory/host_vars/weblate-host/network.yml`
file like so:

.. code::

   ---
   openstack_volumes:
     - name: weblate-volume
       size: 10


Encrypting and Mounting
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The volume can then be encrypted, formatted and mounted by specifying
the mount point in the `encrypted_device_mount_point` variable like so:

.. code::

   ---
   openstack_volumes:
     - name: weblate-volume
       size: 10
   encrypted_device_mount_point: /srv

By default `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ or `Snap
<https://snapcraft.io/>`__ will be set to reside in the
`encrypted_device_mount_point` directory so that the data it contains
is encrypted. It can be disabled with the
`encrypted_volume_for_docker` and `encrypted_volume_for_snap`
variables like so:

.. code::

   ---
   openstack_volumes:
     - name: weblate-volume
       size: 10
   encrypted_device_mount_point: /srv
   encrypted_volume_for_docker: false
   encrypted_volume_for_snap: false

Services
~~~~~~~~

The following services are always available:

* :doc:`icinga <services/monitoring>` for `monitoring <https://icinga.com/>`__ at ``icinga.example.com``.
* :doc:`wazuh <services/ids>` for `Intrusion Detection System <https://wazuh.com/>`__ at ``wazuh.example.com``.
* :doc:`postfix <services/postfix>` for `SMTP server <http://www.postfix.org/>`__ at ``postfix.example.com``.
* `security groups <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/train/admin/security-groups.html>`__ for :ref:`firewall <firewall>`.

Background tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :doc:`Volumes and hosts backups <services/backup>`.
* `Unattended upgrades <https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades>`__.
* Tracking changes in `/etc/ for each machine <http://source.etckeeper.branchable.com>`__.

Access
~~~~~~

The `SSH public keys <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell>`__ found in
files matching ``authorized_keys_globs`` are installed on every machine.

.. code::

   ---
   authorized_keys_globs:
     - ssh_keys/dachary.pub
     - ssh_keys/glen.pub

Low level commands
------------------

The following are not useful if only relying on the ``service``
command above. They can however be helpful to run Ansible or OpenStack
manually.

Managing hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hosts (OpenStack virtual machines) are created automatically when
a service is provided. It is however possible to create a new host or
destroy an existing one.

The first step is to edit ``~/.enough/example.com/inventory/all.yml`` and
add the name of the new host:

.. code::

   ---
   all-hosts:
    hosts:
     my-host:
     bind-host:
     forum-host:
     ...

Creating a new host:

.. code::

   enough --domain example.com host create my-host

SSH to a host:

.. code::

   enough --domain example.com ssh my-host

Deleting a host:

.. code::

   enough --domain example.com host delete my-host

Running openstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `openstack <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient>`__
CLI can be used as follows:

.. code::

   $ enough --domain example.com openstack -- help

Which is exactly equivalent to:

.. code::

   $ OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=~/.enough/example.com/inventory/group_vars/all/clouds.yml \
     openstack --os-cloud ovh help


Running ansible-playbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `ansible-playbook <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html>`__
CLI can be used as follows:

.. code::

   $ enough --domain example.com playbook -- --limit localhost,icinga-host \
     --private-key ~/.enough/example.com/infrastructure_key \
     ~/.enough/example.com/enough-playbook.yml

It implicitly uses the following inventories (via multiple
**--inventory** options), in order (the last inventory listed has
precedence):

* ~/.enough/example.com/inventory
* `built in Enough inventory <https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/tree/master/inventory>`__
