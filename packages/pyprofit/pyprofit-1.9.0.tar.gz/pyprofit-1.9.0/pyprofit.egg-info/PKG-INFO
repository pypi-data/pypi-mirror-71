        *pyprofit* is a python wrapper for `libprofit <https://www.github.com/ICRAR/libprofit>`_.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        *pyprofit* is available in `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyprofit>`_
        and thus can be easily installed via::
        
         pip install pyprofit
        
        Since version 1.8.1 pre-compiled binary versions of the package
        are available for Linux distributions.
        These are offered for convenience
        and come with OpenMP and FFTW support,
        but lack features that some users may want to use,
        like OpenCL, threaded-FFTW
        and some CPU-specific optimizations.
        
        Compiling
        ---------
        
        If you need to *compile* this package
        (either because a binary is not available in your platform,
        or because you want to get the last drop of performance)
        you will need to compile **and install** *libprofit* first.
        For instruction on how to compile and install *libprofit* please read
        `libprofit's documentation <http://libprofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting.html#compiling>`_.
        
        If you need to point to a specific libprofit installation
        set the ``LIBPROFIT_HOME`` environment variable to point to it,
        e.g.::
        
         LIBPROFIT_HOME=/opt/software/libprofit/1.8.0/ pip install pyprofit
        
        Note that most users will need to specify
        a user-writable installation directory
        using the ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/installation/directory`` option
        when invoking ``cmake`` as part of libprofit's compilation.
        This is the same directory that then needs to be specified to pyprofit
        via its ``LIBPROFIT_HOME`` environment variable.
        
        All in all, the process of compiling both libprofit and pyprofit
        should work similar to this::
        
         $> git clone https://github.com/ICRAR/libprofit
         $> mkdir libprofit/build
         $> cd libprofit/build
         $> cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/libprofit/installation/directory
         $> make
         $> make install
         $> LIBPROFIT_HOME=/my/libprofit/installation/directory pip install pyprofit
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        If you are experiencing problems with your installation
        (specially if you are compiling this package)
        try the following::
        
         DISTUTILS_DEBUG=1 PYPROFIT_NO_MUTE=1 python setup.py -v build
