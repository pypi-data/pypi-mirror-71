# How to review a code change

We encourage you to contribute new plugins. We use [gerrithub](https://review.gerrithub.io) for
reviewing proposed changes. The submission process looking something
like this:

1.  Clone the citellus repository:

        git clone git@github.com:citellusorg//citellus.git

1.  Configure the `git-review` tool:

        git-review -s

1.  Check out the proposed change branch:

        Â git-review -d 374436

1.  Run UT against it

        tox

1.  If everything passes successfully, perform a sample usage on available sosreport

        ~/citellus/citellus/citellus.py sosreportfolder

1.  Provide comments and feedback on the gerrithub page for the proposed change

## Things to review

Below are some examples of things we do usually review:

- Use of LANG=C before commands we later grep to avoid end user localization to affect the strings we try to grep
- Use of ${var} vs $var
- Not mangle CITELLUS\_ variables (usually leftovers when testing without using the provided `env-for-debug.sh` variable)
- Trailing spaces on lines or empty lines
- Reuse as maximum code between Live and snapshot mode

  - Use TRAP to generate files we might see in Live and use vars for it, for example:

  ```sh
  if [[ ${CITELLUS_LIVE} -eq 0 ]]; then
      FILE="${CITELLUS_ROOT}/sos_commands/networking/ip_address"
  elif [[ ${CITELLUS_LIVE} -eq 1 ]];then
      FILE=$(mktemp)
      trap "rm ${FILE}" EXIT
      ip address  > ${FILE} 2>&1
  fi
  ```

  - In this way, we do refer to same file in our is_required or is_lineinfile syntax and we do reouse the maximum code for the script
