            The vertices of the polygon. They need not be sorted since the
            order will be determined by the hull.
        normal (sequence of length 3 or None):
            The normal vector to the polygon. If :code:`None`, the normal
            is computed by taking the cross product of the vectors formed
            by the first three vertices :code:`np.cross(vertices[2, :] -

            Providing this argument may be necessary if you have a large
            number of vertices and are rotated significantly out of the
            plane.
