Simple music player for the command line written in Python üêç.

### Why qobra?

When it comes to minimal software, you want to use programs that do one thing,
and do it well. This is exactly what qobra does: play music, and nothing else.

As of version 1.3.0, with qobra you can:

-   Display a list of your music.
-   Play selected song.
-   Play next or previous song.
-   Pause a song.
-   Toggle between Shuffle and Normal mode.
-   Search for a song.

### Installation

qobra is available in the PyPI. To install it run:

```bash
pip install qobra
```

### Dependencies

-   pygame

### Usage {#usage}

```bash
qobra [options] [path to your music directory]
```

**Controls**
| Key       | Function                |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| k         | go up a song            |
| j         | go down a song          |
| l         | play selected song      |
| p         | toggle pause state      |
| q         | exit qobra              |
| o         | play next song          |
| i         | play previous song      |
| s         | switch to shuffle mode  |
| n         | switch to normal mode   |
| /         | bring up the search box |
| Enter     | submit search           |
| Esc       | close the search box    |

### Configuration

qobra will look for a configuration file in ~/.config/qobra/config.py or use
the default configuration if it can't find one. You can copy the sample
config.py file in this repository to ~/.config/qobra/config.py if you want to
have your configuration.

You can customize qobra's colors in the config.py file, as well as set your
music directory to avoid having to write it out on the command line:

```python
music_dir = "~/music"
```

### TO DO's

-   [x] Make next song play after current one finishes.
-   [x] Shuffle mode.
-   [x] Resume song after pausing.
-   [x] Format usage message
-   [ ] Accept individual files as input.
-   [x] Handle window resizing.
-   [ ] Handle unsupported file formats
-   [x] Filter songs
-   [x] Add a config file

### Current Issues

-   qobra may misbehave if you resize the window while the search bar is
    showing (why would you want to do that anyway?).
-   qobra may engage in erratic behaviour if you try to play a song
    with an unsupported file format.
-   ~~qobra will crash if you attempt to run it in a terminal with height less
    than or equal to 33 lines.~~
-   ~~You won't see current playing status nor song if you resize your terminal
    after executing qobra.~~
