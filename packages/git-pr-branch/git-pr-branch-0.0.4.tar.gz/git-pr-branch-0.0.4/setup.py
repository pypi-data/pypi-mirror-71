    'long_description': '# GIT PR branch\n\n`git-pr-branch` is a command line tool designed to manage the relationship between branches and\npull-requests.\n\nAt the moment it only supports Github, but other backends are possible.\n\nYou need to create a personal token in https://github.com/settings/tokens. When you start the\nprogram for the first time, it will ask you for it and store it in a configuration file.\n\n## Checking out pull requests\n\n`git pr-branch checkout 42` will a pull request #42 in a local branch, creating a new branch each\ntime the command is run. Why, you ask? Because it is common for PR authors to amend their commits\nafter a review instead of adding more commits, and as a reviewer it\'s hard to see the differences\nbetween the code you reviewed and the new code. By creating a new branch each time, you can just\ndiff with the previous branch.\n\nIf you have not checked out this PR before, it will create a branch for every existing review in the\nPR\'s history. This way it\'ll be easy to see what\'s changed between earlier reviews even if you did\nnot run the command at that time.\n\n## Displaying branches and pull requests\n\n`git pr-branch show` will list all your local branches and show you whether they are associated with\na pull request, whether that PR is still open or not, and the URL for that PR.\n\n## Purging branches\n\n`git pr-branch purge` will delete the branches that are linked to a closed pull request (or multiple\npull requests that are all closed). This will let you keep your local repo tidy.\n\n## Options\n\nIf the remote name for the repository you\'re forking from (here called "upstream") is not named\n"origin", you can set which remote is your upstream with the `-u` or `--upstream` option. Here is an\nexample: if Bob wants to fork Alice\'s repository he may clone his own fork first and then add\nAlice\'s repository as a remote:\n\n    $ git clone git@github.com:/bob/repo\n    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:/alice/repo\n\nThe original repository is therefore not in the default `origin` remote but in the `upstream` remote.\nIn this configuration, `git-pr-branch` must be used with the `-u` option as such:\n\n    $ git pr-branch -u upstream show\n\nThe value will be set in the local repository\'s configuration and you won\'t need to use the option\nin the future.\n\nIf most of your local repositories don\'t use the remote `origin` as upstream, you can configure a\ndifferent default value in the configuration file. The first-time setup "wizard" will ask you.\n\n\n',
