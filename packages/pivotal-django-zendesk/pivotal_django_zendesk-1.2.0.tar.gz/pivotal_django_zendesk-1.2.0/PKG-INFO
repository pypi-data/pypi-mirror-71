Description: # Django Zendesk
        
        django_zendesk provides single-sign on functionality between a
        django.contrib.auth based site and Zendesk. Other authentication
        systems are compatible as long as they implement the
        `@login_required` decorator.   This differs from the other
        implementations in that it exposes out company, external_id, tags, etc.
        
        ####  Note:
        _This fork provides for changes specifically for Pivotal Energy Solutions_
        
        
        ## SETUP
        
        django_zendesk needs two settings.py variables to be implemented:
        
         * `ZENDESK_URL` : The URL of your support page, will either be on
           zendesk.com or your own domain (via a CNAME record)
         * `ZENDESK_TOKEN` : The authentication token token you receive from
           Zendesk when setting up remote authentication
        
        The only other code setup required is pointing a URL at the
        `django_zendesk.views.authorize` method, it will look something like:
        ```
        (r'zendesk/$', 'django_zendesk.views.authorize')
        ```
        
        Zendesk itself needs a bit of setup, including the URL we just set up
        above and a log-out URL which already should be implemented somewhere
        in your site.
        
        Zendesk's documentation for remote authentication is [here][remote_auth] :
        
        If you're running the tests, make sure to set the `TEST_DATABASE_CHARSET`
        setting so that test databases are created to be utf8 compatible.

        3.  Build the release `rm -rf dist build *egg-info; python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
        4.  Upload the data `twine upload dist/*`
