mugit

This package contains objects used to manage a workspace containing
multiple git repositories.  Each object is represented by a class and
contained in a separate module in the package.

The object classes in the commands list are special in that they are designed
to be used by the mugit command-line tool to take command-line arguments
and use them to perform a specific operation on the workspace and/or its
git repositories, as defined by the command.
