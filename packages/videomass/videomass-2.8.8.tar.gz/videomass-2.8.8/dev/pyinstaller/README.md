# Description

These are the preliminary steps for building a Videomass bundle using
[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/PyInstaller/) on MacOs and Windows
operating systems. Before proceeding, install the dependencies required for
your operating system:

- [MacOs](#mac-os)
- [Windows](#ms-windows)

Then jump to [Building the bundle with pyinstaller](#building-the-bundle-with-pyinstaller)

-----------------
# Building the bundle with pyinstaller 

- Type `python3 -m pip install --user pyinstaller` to install pyinstaller.

- execute `pyinstaller_setup.py` script from its location like this:   
    - `$ python3 pyinstaller_setup.py -s`   
to generate a videomass.spec onto videomass root directory.   
    > 
    > the videomass.spec file is not the same as the one generated by the 
    > pyinstaller template. It is already set up with its own specifications 
    > for videomass. However, you can still handle it by edit the statements of 
    > the class instance to leading any aspect on next bundled application.   
    > see https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec-files.html.

- type `pyinstaller videomass.spec` to building a videomass bundle. This command
create two new folders, `build` and `dist`. The `dist` folder is the location for 
the bundle.
    > <ins>**Note:**</ins>
    >
    > For debug on Windows, even enable `console=True` into videomass.spec, not for
    > production and distribution.

# Mac-Os

One of the tools to easily install everything that is missing on MacOS is
[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tool. However, homebrew uses the "Command Line Tools"
installed on your machine. By default, OS X does not ship with this tool, and you
need to manually install it. One way to install it is to install Xcode, and it
will install these commands as well. But, Xcode is heavy (in filesize), and
unless you are a developer, you wonâ€™t have any need for it. Well, you can do it
by just installing the command line tools only:
```
xcode-select --install
```
Install homebrew!
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
### Python3 installation
```
$ brew install python3
```

### FFmpeg Installation

There are different ways to get FFmpeg, we consider only two here.

- By homebrew (the simply and secure way):
> Before installing FFmpeg you could take a look at this interesting explanation
of its homebrew compilation options: <https://gist.github.com/clayton/6196167>

search for the options you want to enable on homebrew:
<https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg>

Otherwise, get this command for enable all options:
```
brew install ffmpeg --with-chromaprint --with-fdk-aac --with-fontconfig --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-game-music-emu --with-libass --with-libbluray --with-libbs2b --with-libcaca --with-libgsm --with-libmodplug --with-librsvg --with-libsoxr --with-libssh --with-libvidstab --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openh264 --with-openjpeg --with-openssl --with-opus --with-rtmpdump --with-rubberband --with-sdl2 --with-snappy --with-speex --with-tesseract --with-theora --with-tools --with-two-lame --with-wavpack --with-webp --with-x265 --with-xz --with-zeromq --with-zimg
```
- By download the precompiled static binary files:

Go at this page <https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/macos64/static/>, download
your prefered file, then extract the archive. Inside the 'bin' folder you find
the ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay binaries already to use with the terminal app or
by Videomass. Now, you can copy and paste all the `bin` folder to
`/Videomass3/MAcOsxSetup/FFMPEG_BIN/`, or you can set the path later on Videomass.

Also, If you want to get separately the ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay installers
statically compiled and ready to install, you can download them at the following site:

<http://www.evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/>
<http://www.evermeet.cx/ffprobe/>
<http://www.evermeet.cx/ffplay/>

Note, however, that they may have limitations for reasons related to distribution
(such as lack of AAC support)

### Create a virtual environment
To build a Videomass.app I suggest you create a virtual environment, Exhaustive
guides to doing this are as follows:   
- <https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/>
- <https://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPythonVirtualenvOnMac>
- <https://www.metachris.com/2015/11/create-standalone-mac-os-x-applications-with-python-and-py2app/>

- Make sure you have pip, then install:
   - `python -m pip install --user wxPython`
   
   - `python -m pip install --user PyPubSub`

- Download the [Videomass](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass) TAR or ZIP
sources and extract the archive.

-----------------
# MS-Windows

- Install Python>=3.7

- Make sure you have pip, then install:
   - `python -m pip install wxPython`

   - `python -m pip install PyPubSub`

- Download the [Videomass](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass) TAR or ZIP
sources and extract the archive.
