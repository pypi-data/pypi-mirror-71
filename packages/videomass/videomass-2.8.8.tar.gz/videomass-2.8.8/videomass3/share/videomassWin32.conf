# Version number of this configuration file:
# When changing the version number, make sure it matches the version number
# in the "/vdms_SYS/ctrl_run.py" file on the "check videomass.conf and
# configuration folder" section. This will automatically restore the current
# version of the configuration file in the user conf. directory
2.0

# set default directory to file save:
none

# FFmpeg always has one main thread which does most of the processing.
# In case of multiple inputs there are also input threads for demuxing
# (1 thread per input); for single input demuxing is done on main thread.
# Setting "threads N" (where N > 1) on input enables multithreaded decoding
# which can spawn N additional threads for each decoder which supports it.
# Set the number of threads (from 0 to 32), default 1:
-threads 4

#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
# LOGLEVEL OPTION ffplay/ffmpeg:
# FFmpeg output messages are on stderr (excluse ffprobe); Videomass uses
# 'loglevel' option to capture and redirect output to log. Changing the
# following logging level would also change the behavior of the output
# on log messages and error messages.

# !! WARNING !!
# the -stats option print progress report during encoding, useful for the
# progress bar and the percentage progress label. Changing the -stats option,
# Videomass would not work correctly. Note that only in some cases the -stats
# option is explicitly excluded on the code.
#
# -hide_banner, is used to suppress printing initial informations of FFmpeg;
# -nostdin, it disables interaction on standard input since Videomass uses
# ffmpeg as background process.

# Set loglevel and options for FFplay:
-loglevel error -hide_banner

# Set loglevel and options for FFmpeg:
-loglevel warning -stats -hide_banner -nostdin
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#

# EXECUTABLES BINARY:
# Videomass support custom executables links of FFmpeg, FFprobe and FFplay
# binaries. These links refer to paths managed by users who want to use
# other versions of FFmpeg in their user-space. If these options are not
# used, videomass will use executables installed in the system by default

# Activation FFmpeg executable (boolean values = true/false):
false
# executable path-names of FFmpeg:
ffmpeg.exe

# Activation FFprobe executable (boolean values = true/false):
false
# executable path-names of FFprobe:
ffprobe.exe

# Activation FFplay executable (boolean values = true/false):
false
# executable path-names of FFplay:
ffplay.exe

# Activation mpv player executable (boolean values = true/false):
false
# executable path-names of mpv player:
