**[Magenta](https://g.co/magenta)** is a research project exploring the role of machine learning
in the process of creating art and music.

This is the home for our serializable `NoteSequence` representation along with
utilities for:

* creating them from various formats (e.g., MIDI, abc, MusicXML)
* manipulating them (e.g., slicing, quantizing)
* extracting components (e.g., melodies, drum tracks, chord)
* exporting them (e.g., to MIDI or audio)
* or converting them to representations useful for model training (e.g., one-hot tensors)

To learn more see the main [magenta repo](https://github.com/magenta/magenta) and have look at the [hello magenta](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/magenta/hello_magenta/hello_magenta.ipynb) notebook.

## Installation

`pip install note-seq`
