Description: # About
        KahootPY is a library to interact with the Kahoot API. KahootPY supports joining and interacting with quizzes and ~challenges (not yet)~.
        
        # Installation
        
        `pip install -U KahootPY`
        
        ```py
        from kahoot import client
        bot = client()
        bot.join(12345,"KahootPY")
        def joinHandle():
          pass
        bot.on("joined",joinHandle)
        ```
        
        Since this is basically a translation of JavaScript to Python, expect issues and bugs.
        
        Documentation:
        See [kahoot.js-updated](https://github.com/theusaf/kahoot.js-updated/blob/master/Documentation.md). The API is very similar, besides having no Promises.
