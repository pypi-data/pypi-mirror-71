    """Request stream gauge data from the USGS NWIS.

    Args:
        site (str or list of strings):
            a valid site is '01585200' or ['01585200', '01646502']. site
            should be None if stateCd or countyCd are not None.

        service (str):
            can either be 'iv' or 'dv' for instantaneous or daily data.
            'dv'(default): daily values. Mean value for an entire day.
            'iv': instantaneous value measured at this time. Also known
            as 'Real-time data'. Can be measured as often as every
            five minutes by the USGS. 15 minutes is more typical.

        start_date (str):
           should take on the form yyyy-mm-dd

        end_date (str):
            should take on the form yyyy-mm-dd

        stateCd (str):
            a valid two-letter state postal abbreviation. Default is None.

        countyCd (str or list of strings):
            a valid county abbreviation. Default is None.

        bBox (str, list, or tuple):
            a set of coordinates that defines a bounding box.
                * Coordinates are in decimal degrees
                * Longitude values are negative (west of the prime meridian).
                * Latitude values are positive (north of the equator).
                * comma-delimited, no spaces, if provided as a string.
                * The order of the boundaries should be: "West,South,East,North"
                * Example: "-83.000000,36.500000,-81.000000,38.500000"

        parameterCd (str):
            NWIS parameter code. Default is stream discharge '00060'
                * stage: '00065'
                * discharge: '00060'
                * not all sites collect all parameters!
                * See https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/pmcodes for full list

        period (str):
            NWIS period code. Default is None.
                * Format is "PxxD", where xx is the number of days before \
                today, with a maximum of 999 days accepted.
                * Either use start_date or period, but not both.

    Returns:
        a response object. This function will always return the response,
            even if the NWIS returns a status_code that indicates a problem.

            * response.url: the url we used to request data
            * response.status_code: '200' when okay; see <https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html>
            * response.json: the content translated as json
            * response.status_code: the internet status code
                - '200': is a good request
                - non-200 codes will be reported as a warning.
                - '400': is a 'Bad Request'-- the parameters did not make sense
            * response.ok: "True" when we get a '200' status_code

    Raises:
        ConnectionError: due to connection problems like refused connection
            or DNS Error.

        SyntaxWarning: when NWIS returns a response code that is not 200.

    Example::

        >>> import hydrofunctions as hf
        >>> response = hf.get_nwis('01585200', 'dv', '2012-06-01', '2012-07-01')

        >>> response
        <response [200]>

        >>> response.json()
        *JSON ensues*

        >>> hf.extract_nwis_df(response)
        *a Pandas dataframe appears*

    Other Valid Ways to Make a Request::

        >>> sites = ['07180500', '03380475', '06926000'] # Request a list of sites.
        >>> service = 'iv'  # Request real-time data
        >>> days = 'P10D'  # Request the last 10 days.
        >>> stage = '00065' # Sites that collect discharge usually collect water depth too.
        >>> response2 = hf.get_nwis(sites, service, period=days, parameterCd=stage)

    Request Data By Location::

        >>> # Request the most recent daily data for every site in Maine
        >>> response3 = hf.get_nwis(None, 'dv', stateCd='ME')
        >>> response3
        <Response [200]>
