This module is for working with the various USGS dataservices that use the rdb
text format. These include the statistics service, the field measurements
service, the rating curve service, and the peak discharge service.

    **Discussion:**
        The USGS operates over 8,000 stream gages around the United States and
        territories. Each of these sensors records the depth, or 'stage' of the
        water. In order to translate this stage data into stream discharge, the
        USGS staff creates an empirical relationship called a 'rating curve'
        between the river stage and stream discharge. To construct this curve,
        the USGS personnel visit all of the gage every one to eight weeks, and
        measure the stage and the discharge of the river manually.

        The ``field_meas()`` function returns all of the field-collected data for
        this site. The USGS uses these data to create the rating curve. You can use
        these data to see how the site has changed over time, or to
        read the notes about local conditions.

        The ``rating_curve()`` function returns the most recent 'expanded shift-
        adjusted' rating curve constructed for this site. This is the current official
        rating curve.

        To plot a rating curve from the field measurements, use::

            >>> header, data = hf.field_meas('01581830')

            >>> data.plot(x='gage_height_va', y='discharge_va', kind='scatter')

        Rating curves are typically plotted with the indepedent variable,
        gage_height, plotted on the Y axis.

    Note:
        This function is based on the USGS statistics service, described here:
        https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Statistics-Service.html

        The USGS Statistics Service allows you to specify a wide array of
        additional parameters in your request. You can provide these parameters
        as keyword arguments, like in this example::

            >>> hf.stats('01452500', parameterCD='00060')

        This will only request
        statistics for discharge, which is specified with the '00060'
        parameter code.

        Additional useful parameters include:

            - `parameterCD='00060,00065'` Limit the request for statistics to
              only one parameter or to a list of parameters. The default behavior
              is to provide statistics for every parameter that has been measured
              at this site. In this example, statistics for discharge ('00060')
              and stage ('00065') are requested.

            - `statYearType='water'` Calculate annual statistics based on the
              water year, which runs from October 1st to September 31st. This
              parameter is only for use with annual reports. If not specified,
              the default behavior will use calendar years for reporting.

            - `missingData='on'`  Calculate statistics even when there are some
              missing values. If not specified, the default behavior is to drop
              years that have fewer than 365 values from annual reports, and to
              drop months that have fewer than 30 values in monthly reports. The
              number of values used to calculate a statistic is reported in the
              'count_nu' column.
