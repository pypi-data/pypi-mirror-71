    """Draws a map of stream gages in a Jupyter Notebook.

    This function will draw an interactive map of stream gages from
    hydrocloud.org into an iframe and display it in a Jupyter Notebook.
    Each dot represents a stream gage. Click on the dot to learn its name,
    which you can use to request data.

    Args:
        width (int): The width of the map iframe.
        height (int): The height of the map iframe.
        url (str): The URL to put inside of the IFrame. Defaults to\
        https://hydrocloud.org

    Returns:
        HTML display object.

    Example:
        >>> import hydrofunctions as hf
        >>> hf.draw_map()

        A map appears.

        >>> hf.draw_map(width=900, height=600)

        Draws a larger map.

    TODO:
        use ipywidgets to allow users to click on the map, and this will
        return a value that can be used in another IPython cell. This
        feature would allow the map to act as an interactive site selection
        tool.
