exceptions.py

This module contains all of the custom exceptions defined in this package. The
base class is HydroException, and all custom exceptions are subclasses of
HydroException.

Use the errors like this::

    try:
        #some code here that might return no data
        #more code that might get encoded improperly
    except HydroNoDataError('This site has no data'):
        # handle error here.
    except HydroEncodeError():
        # handle this error here.
    else:
        # code to complete if there is no exception raised.
    finally:
        # code that you want to run whether an exception is raised or not.
        # If an exception wasn't caught, then this code gets run, and the
        # exception gets re-raised after this finally clause gets run.

Keep the try clause short: if you put too many things in there, it can be
difficult to figure out what broke. On the other hand, like in my example
above, it is more readable if you group a series of statements and then
handle their exceptions together.

Example::

    raise HydroNoDataError("Oh no, NWIS doesn't have this data for you!")

        that doesn't exits.
