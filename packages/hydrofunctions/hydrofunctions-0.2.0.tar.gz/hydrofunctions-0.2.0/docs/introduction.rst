Introduction
============

Hydrofunctions is an open source, free-to-use Python package containing tools
for downloading, plotting, analyzing, and storing hydrology data. It is
designed to be simple enough for Python beginners, yet powerful enough for
scientific research.

Hydrofunctions accesses the the US Geological Survey's
National Water Information System (NWIS), which includes data from thousands
of active sensors around the US and Territories. The internal design
preserves important metadata while facilitating rapid analysis. Detailed
error messages help users figure out why a request went wrong. Sensible
defaults make it possible to get started right away while still maintaining
your access to all of the NWIS's sophisticated functionality.

Hydrofunctions is typically used with Jupyter Notebooks, and it incorporates
the functionality of Pandas, Numpy, and matplotlib.

Please give it a try!

Features
========

* Retrieves stream data from the USGS NWIS service
* Select data using multiple site numbers, by state, county codes, or a boundary box
* Preserves NWIS metadata, including NoData values
* Helpful error messages to help you write valid requests
* Extracts data into a Pandas dataframe, json, or dict
* Plot beautiful graphs in Jupyter Notebooks
   * hydrographs (or time series of any data)
   * flow duration charts
   * cycle plots to illustrate annual or diurnal cycles
   * Interactive map for finding stream gauge ID numbers
* Plotting and manipulation through Pandas dataframes
* Retrieve peak discharges, rating curves, field notes, and statistics for sites
* Saves data in compact, easy-to-use parquet files instead of requesting the same dataset repeatedly


Quick start
===========

Hydrofunctions can be used from the Python command line, but its graphing
capabilities require the use of Jupyter, which is easily downloaded
and installed from Anaconda.org.

Before we use Hydrofunctions, we must download and install it on our local
computer. You can do this from your computer's command line prompt, which you
can access from your recently installed Anaconda distribution::

    (base) C:\> pip install hydrofunctions

Pip will make sure that you have everything that you need on your computer, and
load everything you don't have.

Now, open a new Jupyter notebook. You can find an icon for Jupyter within the
Anaconda Navigator application.

In the first cell, import hydrofunctions for use on your page::

    >>> import hydrofunctions as hf

To enable chart plotting in Jupyter, add::

    >>> %matplotlib inline

Next, request ten days of data from the USGS National Water Information
System (NWIS)::

    >>> site = '01570500'
    >>> harrisburg = hf.NWIS(site, 'iv', period='P10D')
    Requested data from https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?format=json%2C1.1&sites=01570500&period=P10D

Use the 'ok' attribute to check that the transfer went okay::

    >>> harrisburg.ok
    True

Find out about what we collected::

    >>> harrisburg
    USGS:01570500: Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, PA
        00045: <30 * Minutes> Precipitation, total, inches
        00060: <30 * Minutes> Discharge, cubic feet per second
        00065: <30 * Minutes> Gage height, feet
    Start: 2019-04-06 00:30:00+00:00
    End:   2019-04-15 23:00:00+00:00

This listing reports the site ID and name for the site we requested, followed
by a list of all of the parameters collected at this site. For each parameter,
it lists the parameter code, how frequently the data are collected for this
parameter, and the name of the parameter written out with units. The start and
end times of the dataset are given in Universal Time (UTC).

You can output the data as a JSON dict using the `.json` attribute, or as a
Pandas dataframe by using the .df() method.  The .df() method takes parameters
to limit what data will go into the dataframe.

View the first five rows of a dataframe that only contains the discharge data::

    >>> harrisburg.df('discharge').head()

Our data appears in a table...

Because the .df() method returns a dataframe, you have access to all of the
methods associated with Pandas, including .plot(), .describe(), and .info() !

Plot the data using Pandas and mathplotlib::

    >>> herring.df('q').plot()

.. image:: _static/HerringHydrograph.png
        :alt: a stream hydrograph for Herring Run

As long as you had `%matplotlib inline` enabled earlier, you will get a graph.

To learn more about hydrofunctions, try using::

    >>> help(hf)

and::

    >>> dir(response)

to list all of the methods available.
