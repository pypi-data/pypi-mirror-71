django-inlinecss-redux
======================

This project was born in 2017 when ``django-inlinecss`` was inactive. I needed
to fix a bug, so I make my own fork in order to push this to PyPI.

Since then, upstream has come back to life, and fixed the issue I had.
This project is therefore redundant. Please use `django-inlinecss
<https://github.com/roverdotcom/django-inlinecss>`_.
