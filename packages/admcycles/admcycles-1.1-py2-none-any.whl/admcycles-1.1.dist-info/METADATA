admcycles
=========

admcycles is a `SageMath <https://www.sagemath.org>`_ module to compute with
the tautological ring of the moduli spaces of complex curves. You can install
it on top of a SageMath installation on your computer (see the instructions
below). You can alternatively use one of the online services below that have
admcycles already installed:

- `SageMathCell <https://sagecell.sagemath.org/>`_: An online service for
  SageMath computations that does not require authentification.

- `CoCalc <https://cocalc.com/>`_: A complete computation environment that
  offers a free plan subscription (with limited resources).

admcycles includes the `SageMath <https://www.sagemath.org>`_ module diffstrata
to compute with the tautological ring of the moduli space of multi-scale 
differentials, a compactification of strata of flat surfaces. It is particularly
tailored towards computing Euler characteristics of these spaces.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure that `SageMath <https://www.sagemath.org>`_ is installed on your
computer. Detailed installation instructions for different operating systems
are available `here
<http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/binary.html>`_ and on the
SageMath website.

All the command below must be run inside a console (the last character of the
prompt is usally a ``$``). On Windows this is called ``SageMath Shell`` while
on linux and MacOS this is often referred to as a ``terminal``.

Inside the console, we assume that the command ``sage`` launches a Sage
session (whose prompt is usually ``sage:``). To quit the Sage session
type ``quit`` and press ``Enter``.

Installation with pip (the Python package manager)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most convenient way to use admcycles is to add the package to your
Sage installation. The exact procedure for this depends on your operating
system and how you installed Sage. If the pip installation fails, see
the sections `Manual installation with pip` or `Use without installation`
below.

- If you manually installed Sage by downloading it from the website, then run
  in a shell console::

      $ sage -pip install admcycles --user

  Here, the ``--user`` is an optional argument to ``pip`` which, when
  provided, will install admcycles not inside the Sage folder but in your home
  directory.

- If you have a linux distribution and installed the sagemath package via your
  package manager then run in a shell console::

     $ pip install admcycles --user

  The ``pip`` command above might have to be changed to ``pip2`` or ``pip3``
  depending on your system. Also, on Debian/Ubuntu systems, the following step
  might be necessary before running the above command::

     $ source /usr/share/sagemath/bin/sage-env

Manual installation with pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The automatic installation with pip from Section `Installation with pip` might
fail. One common reason is the lack of SSL support of the SageMath binaries. In
such situation you can follow the procedure below that bypass the connection of
``pip`` to the web.

- Download the admcycles package as a ``tar.gz``-file or ``.zip`` file either from `PyPI
  <https://pypi.org/project/admcycles/>`_ or from `gitlab
  <https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/-/archive/master/admcycles-master.tar.gz>`__.

- Inside a shell console run::

      $ sage -pip install /where/is/the/package.tar.gz --user

  Here, the ``--user`` is an optional argument to ``pip`` which, when
  provided, will install admcycles not inside the Sage folder but in your home
  directory.

Installation of the development version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to install the development version, you need to have the
versioning software ``git`` installed. The only change in the procedure
is to replace ``admcycles`` in the any of the command above by
``git+https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles``.

Upgrade
^^^^^^^

If you have already installed admcycles and a new version appears on PyPI, you
can update your installation by appending the option ``--upgrade`` above.

Use without installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the package without installing, download the package as a ``.zip`` or
``.tar.gz``-file either from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/admcycles/>`_ or
from `gitlab
<https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/-/archive/master/admcycles-master.zip>`__.
Unpack the ``.zip`` or ``.tar.gz`` file. This creates a folder which should
contain a file ``setup.py``. In order to use the
module, you need to run Sage from this folder. For example, if the full path of
this folder is ``/u/You/Downloads/admcycles``, you could do::

    $ cd /u/You/Downloads/admcycles
    $ sage

Or directly inside a Sage session::

    sage: cd /u/You/Downloads/admcycles

If you run Sage in Windows using cygwin, the path above should be a cygwin path
and will looks something like
``/cygdrive/c/Users/You/Downloads/admcycles-master``.

Example
-------

To start using admcycles, start a Sage session (either in the command line, or
a Jupyter notebook, or inside one of the online services). Then type::

    sage: from admcycles import *

To try a first computation, you can compute the degree of the class kappa_1 on
Mbar_{1,1} by::

    sage: kappaclass(1,1,1).evaluate()
    1/24

You can have a look at the above computation directly in `SageMathCell <https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJxLK8rPVUhMyU2uTM5JLVbIzC3ILypR0OLlyk4sKEhMzkksLtYw1FEAIU291LLEnNLEklQNTQAYbhIb&lang=sage&interacts=eJyLjgUAARUAuQ==>`__.

Here is a more advanced computation::

    sage: t1 = 3*sepbdiv(1,(1,2),3,4) - psiclass(4,3,4)^2
    sage: t1
    Graph :      [1, 2] [[1, 2, 5], [3, 4, 6]] [(5, 6)]
    Polynomial : 3*
    <BLANKLINE>
    Graph :      [3] [[1, 2, 3, 4]] []
    Polynomial : (-1)*psi_4^2

To use diffstrata, the package must be imported separately. Type::

    sage: from admcycles.diffstrata import *

To try a first computation, you can compute the Euler characteristic of the
minimal stratum H(2) in genus 2::

    sage: X = Stratum((2,))
    sage: X.euler_characteristic()
    -1/40

Here is a more advanced computation::

    sage: X = Stratum((1,1))
    sage: (X.xi^2 * X.psi(1) * X.psi(2)).evaluate()
    -1/720

Building documentation
----------------------

To build the documentation, go in the repository docs/ and
then run in a console::

    $ sage -sh
    (sage-sh)$ make html
    (sage-sh)$ exit

The documentation is then available in docs/build/

Running doctests
----------------

To run doctests, use the following command::

    $ sage -t --force-lib admcycles/ docs/source

If it succeeds, you should see a message::

    All tests passed!
