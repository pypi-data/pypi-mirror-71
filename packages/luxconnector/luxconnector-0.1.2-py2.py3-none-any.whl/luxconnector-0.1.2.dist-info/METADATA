luxconnector
-----

This is a python wrapper for the Lux Client windows solution.
The package will only work on Windows.

# Installation
To install this package follow the these steps:

## Step 1: Divers
Make sure you have or had a [CytoSmart application installed](http://download.cytosmart.com/). 
This is needed to have all the correct drivers installed.
It doesn't matter if the app is uninstalled afterwards.

## Step 2: pip install
```
pip install luxconnector
```

# Usage

Make sure the lux is physically connected to your computer via a USB3 port.
The luxconnector is an object that maintains the connection with the Lux.
To create the object use the following code:

```
from luxconnector import LuxConnector
connector = LuxConnector()
```

## Getting a single image
When you want a single image taken at this moment use get_image.
This will return the image as a [`numpy array`](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.array.html).

```
img = connector.get_image()
```

## Changing the focus
This function will change the focus for the luxconnector object.
Every image taken after this function will have the new focus.

The focus is in the range 0 until 1. (0.0 and 1.0 are valid entries)

```
connector.set_focus(0.5)
img1 = connector.get_image() # Image with focus of 0.5
connector.set_focus(0.7)
img2 = connector.get_image() # Image with focus of 0.7
img3 = connector.get_image() # Image with focus of 0.7
```

## Getting a z-stack
This function will return a list of [`numpy arrays`](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.array.html).
Each image will be at a different focus level.

This code will create a z-stack of 6 images.
The focuses of these images will be [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
```
list_of_imgs = connector.get_z_stack(num_img = 6, start_focus = 0.5, stop_focus = 1)
```

## Changing zoom modes
There are 2 zoom modes: "IN" and "OUT".
While zoomed in the resolution is higher but the ROI is smaller, zoomed out has a higher ROI but a lower resolution.

Changing this will change it for every image or z-stack taken afterwards.

```
connector.set_zoom("IN")
img1 = connector.get_image() # Image is zoomed in
connector.set_zoom("OUT")
img2 = connector.get_image() # Image is zoomed out
```

## Live view
The live view of the Lux is hosted at http://localhost:3333/luxservice/live.
This image can only been seen if the live view is turned on (by default the live view is turned on).

```
connector.set_liveview(True) # in the browser you can see the image being updated
connector.set_liveview(False) # Led of Lux turns off till you take a picture
```
