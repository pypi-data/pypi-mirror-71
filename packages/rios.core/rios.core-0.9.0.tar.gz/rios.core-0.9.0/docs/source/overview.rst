.. _`Python`: https://www.python.org
.. _`RIOS`: https://rios.readthedocs.org


Example Usage
=============

This package exposes a handful of simple functions for validating and
formatting the standard RIOS data structures::

    >>> from rios.core import validate_instrument, get_instrument_json

    >>> instrument = {"foo": "bar", "id": "urn:my-instrument", "title": "An Instrument Title", "record": [{"id": "field1","type": "text"}], "version": "1.0"}
    >>> validate_instrument(instrument)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    colander.Invalid: {'': u'Unrecognized keys in mapping: "{\'foo\': \'bar\'}"'}

    >>> del instrument['foo']
    >>> validate_instrument(instrument)

    >>> print get_instrument_json(instrument)
    {
      "id": "urn:my-instrument",
      "version": "1.0",
      "title": "An Instrument Title",
      "record": [
        {
          "id": "field1",
          "type": "text"
        }
      ]
    }
