# pygments-http

----

A minimalistic Pygments lexer for the output of [`httpie`](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie).

The main lexer class here borrows code heavily from the `ColorFormatter` class from `httpie`.

The `httpie` license is included in the root of this repository.

Sample output:
