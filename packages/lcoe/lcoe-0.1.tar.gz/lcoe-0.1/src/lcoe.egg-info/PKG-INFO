        Description
        ===========
        
        Calculate levelised cost of electricity on the command line with the ``lcoe`` command::
        
            $ lcoe 500000000 2000000000 25000000 0.07 20
            LCOE is 0.03609823143581392
        
        Use the lcoe library in your Python code::
        
            from lcoe import lcoe
        
            operating_cost = 25000000  #$million/year
            capital_cost = 500000000  # $million
            discount_rate = 0.07  # %
            lifetime = 20
            annual_output = 2000000000  # kWh
        
            lcoe(annual_output, capital_cost, operating_cost, discount_rate, lifetime)
