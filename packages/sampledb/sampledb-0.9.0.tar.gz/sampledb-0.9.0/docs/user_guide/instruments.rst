Instruments
===========

Instruments in |service_name| map real instruments in JÃ¼lich or at other facilities to :ref:`actions` performed with them.

You can view a list of instruments at |service_instruments_url|. To make navigating the growing list of instruments easier, users can select **favorites** by clicking the star next to an instrument's name.

.. note::
    At this time, instruments can only be created by the |service_name| administrators. If you would like your instrument or action to be included, please `let us know`_.

Instrument Scientists
---------------------

Most instruments are associated with one or more **instrument scientists**, who will automatically be granted permissions for all objects created with their instruments. For more information on how permissions are handled, see :ref:`permissions`.
