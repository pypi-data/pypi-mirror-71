        This is a maintained fork from the original repo- https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent. 
        
        ## Requirements
        MAgent supports Linux and macOS and Python 3.5+
        
        
        ## Install instructions
        Note that the library is built during pip installation (it doesn't take to long).
        
        Linux:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-system-dev libjsoncpp-dev libwebsocketpp-dev
        
        pip3 install magent
        ```
        
        macOS:
        
        ```bash
        
        brew install cmake llvm boost@1.55
        brew install jsoncpp argp-standalone
        brew tap davidzhen0/homebrew-websocketpp
        brew install --HEAD davidzhen0/websocketpp/websocketpp
        brew link --force boost@1.55
        
        pip3 install magent
        ```
