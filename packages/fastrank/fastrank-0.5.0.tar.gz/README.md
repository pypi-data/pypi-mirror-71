# FastRank ![CI Status Badge](https://github.com/jjfiv/fastrank/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/fastrank.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/fastrank)

My most frequently used learning-to-rank algorithms ported to rust for efficiency.

Read my [blog-post](https://jjfoley.me/2019/10/11/fastrank-alpha.html) announcing the first public version: 0.4. It's alpha because I think the API needs work, not because there's any sort of known correctness or compatiblity issues.

## Windows not supported

I'm in progress of finding a VM to test this with; if you're interested in Windows support, let me know. Tracking issue here: [Windows Support](https://github.com/jjfiv/fastrank/issues/30).

## Python Usage 

```shell
pip install fastrank
```
