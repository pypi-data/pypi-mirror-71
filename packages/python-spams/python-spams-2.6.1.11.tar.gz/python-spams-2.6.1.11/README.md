# SPAMS 2.6.1 and python

SPAMS (SPArse Modeling Software) is an optimization toolbox for solving various sparse estimation problems.

-   Dictionary learning and matrix factorization:
	- NMF
	- sparse PCA
-   Solving sparse decomposition problems:
	- LARS
	- coordinate descent
	- OMP
	- proximal methods
-   Solving structured sparse decomposition problems:
	- l1/l2
	- l1/linf
	- sparse group lasso
	- tree-structured regularization
	- structured sparsity with overlapping groups.

Manipulated objects are imported from numpy and scipy. Matrices should be stored by columns, and sparse matrices should be "column compressed".

### Installation from PyPI:

The standard installation uses the BLAS and LAPACK libraries used by Numpy:
```bash
pip install python-spams
```

### Installation from sources

Make sure you have install libblas & liblapack (see below)
```bash
pip install -e .
```


### Testing the interface :
```bash
python tests/test_spams.py -h # to get help
python tests/test_spams.py    # will run all the tests
```

### Comments
Carefully install libblas & liblapack. For example on ubuntu, necessary to `sudo apt-get -y install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran`. For MacOs, you most likely need to `brew install gcc openblas lapack`
