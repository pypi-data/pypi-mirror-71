What is margot?
===============

Margot is a library of components that may be used together or separately. The first
major component; *margot.data* is now available for public preview. It should be
considered an early-beta. It works, but may still have sharp edges.

What is margot data?
====================

Margot data makes it super easy to create neat and tidy Pandas dataframes for 
time-series analysis.

Margot data aims to manage data collection, caching, cleaning, feature generation,
management and persistence using a clean, declarative API. If you've ever used
Django you'll find this approach similar to the Django ORM.

Columns
-------

The heart of any time-series dataframe is the original data. Margot can retrieve
time-series data from external sources (currently AlphaVantage). To add a time-
series from an original source, such as "closing_price" or "volume", we declare
a *Column*\ :

e.g. Let's get closing_price and volume from AlphaVantage:

.. code-block::

   adjusted_close = av.Column(function='historical_daily_adjusted', 
                              time_series='adjusted_close')

   daily_volume = av.Column(function='historical_daily_adjusted',
                            time_series='volume')


Features
--------

Columns are useful, but we usually want to derive new time-series from them, such 
as "log_returns" or "SMA20". Margot does this for you; we've called these derived
time-series, *Features*.

.. code-block::

   simple_returns = finance.SimpleReturns(column='adjusted_close')
   log_returns = finance.LogReturns(column='adjusted_close')
   sma20 = finance.SimpleMovingAverage(column='adjusted_close', window=20)


Features can be piled on top of one another. For example, to create a time-series
of realised volatility based on log_returns with a lookback of 30 trading days,
simply add the following feature:

.. code-block::

   realised_vol = finance.RealisedVolatility(column='log_returns', window=30)


Margot includes many common financial Features, and we'll be adding more soon. It's 
also very easy to add your own.

Symbols
-------

Often, you want to make a dataframe combining a number of columns and features.
Margot makes this very easy by providing the Symbol class e.g.

.. code-block::

   class MyEquity(Symbol):

       adjusted_close = av.Column(function='historical_daily_adjusted', 
                                  time_series='adjusted_close')
       log_returns = finance.LogReturns(column='adjusted_close')
       realised_vol = finance.RealisedVolatility(column='log_returns', 
                                                 window=30)
       upper_band = finance.UpperBollingerBand(column='adjusted_close', 
                                               window=20, 
                                               width=2.0)
       sma20 = finance.SimpleMovingAverage(column='adjusted_close', 
                                           window=20)
       lower_band = finance.LowerBollingerBand(column='adjusted_close', 
                                               window=20, 
                                               width=2.0)

   spy = MyEquity(symbol='SPY')


MargotDataFrames
----------------

You usually you want to look at more than one symbol. That's where
MargotDataFrames come in. MargotDataFrames combine multiple
Symbols with dataframe-wide Features and Ratios. For example:

.. code-block::

   class MyEnsemble(MargotDataFrame):
       spy = MyEquity(symbol='SPY')
       iwm = MyEquity(symbol='IWM')
       spy_iwm_ratio = Ratio(numerator=spy.adjusted_close, 
                             denominator=iwm.adjusted_close,
                             label='spy_iwm_ratio')

   my_df = MyEnsemble().to_pandas() 


The above code creates a Pandas DataFrame of two equities, and an additional
feature that calculates a time-series of the ratio of their respective
adjusted close prices.

Margot's other parts
--------------------

**not yet released.**

Margot aims to provide a simple framework for writing and backtesting trading
signal generation algorithms using margot.data.

Results from margot's trading algorithms can be analysed with pyfolio.

Getting Started
===============

.. code-block::

   pip install margot


Next you need to make sure you have a couple of important environment variables set:

.. code-block::

   export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
   export DATA_CACHE=PATH_TO_FOLDER_TO_STORE_HDF5_FILES


Once you've done that, try running the code in the `notebook <https://margot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.margot.data.html>`_.

Status
======

This is still an early stage software project, and should not be used for live trading.

Documentation
=============

in progress - for examples see the `notebook <https://margot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.margot.data.html>`_.

Contributing
============

Feel free to make a pull request or chat about your idea first using `issues <https://github.com/atkinson/margot/issues>`_.

Dependencies are kept to a minimum. Generally if there's a way to do something in the standard library (or numpy / Pandas), let's do it that way rather than add another library.
