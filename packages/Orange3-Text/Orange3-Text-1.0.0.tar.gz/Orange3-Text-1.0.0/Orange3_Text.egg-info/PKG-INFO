        ============
        
        Orange add-on for text mining. It provides access to publicly available data,
        like NY Times, Twitter and PubMed. Further, it provides tools for preprocessing,
        constructing vector spaces (like bag-of-words, topic modeling and word2vec) and
        visualizations like word cloud end geo map. All features can be combined with
        powerful data mining techniques from the Orange data mining framework.
