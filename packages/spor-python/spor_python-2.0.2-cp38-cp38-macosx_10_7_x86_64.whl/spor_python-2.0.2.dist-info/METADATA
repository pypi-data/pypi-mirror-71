# spor-python

Python bindings for [spor](https://github.com/abingham/spor).

## Building

You can do basic building with cargo:

```
cargo build
```

### Wheels, etc.

Alternatively, you can build with [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin). This not only does a normal cargo build,
but it can also things like build wheels.

To use it, you first need to install it with `pip`:

```
pip install maturin
```

Then use maturin to build:

```
maturin build
```

Note that you may need to specify a particular Python interpreter:

```
maturin build --i python3.8
```

### Build issues?

We use [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/PyO3) to generate the Python bindings, so read their docs
if you have any trouble building (particularly on macos).
