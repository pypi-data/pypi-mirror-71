Release 0.12.1 (2020-06-11)
---------------------------

This is a bugfix release. According to #32, a patch has been applied to fix ImportError with Django 3.1.

Release 0.12.0 (2019-12-05)
---------------------------
**Requirements**

- Django 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0 are now officially supported. Thanks to @atodorov for 3.0 compatibility
- Added Python 3.7 and 3.8 support
- Dropped Python 3.3 support

**Improvements**

- To ensure compatibility with `JSON-RPC 1.2`_, 2 more "Content-Type" values are supported by JSON-RPC Handler:
  "application/json-rpc" and "application/jsonrequest" (`#24`_). Thanks to @dansan

.. _JSON-RPC 1.2: https://www.jsonrpc.org/historical/json-rpc-over-http.html
.. _#24: https://github.com/alorence/django-modern-rpc/issues/24

Release 0.11.1 (2018-05-13)
---------------------------
**Improvements**

Last release introduced some undocumented breaking API changes regarding RPC registry management. Old API has been
restored for backward compatibility. The following global functions are now back in the API:

- modernrpc.core.register_rpc_method()
- modernrpc.core.get_all_method_names()
- modernrpc.core.get_all_methods()
- modernrpc.core.get_method()
- modernrpc.core.reset_registry()

In addition, some improvements have been applied to unit tests, to make sure test environment is the same after each
test function. In addition, some exclusion patterns have been added in .coveragerc file to increase coverage report
accuracy.

Release 0.11.0 (2018-04-25)
---------------------------
**Improvements**

- Django 2.0 is now officially supported. Tox and Travis default config have been updated to integrate Django 2.0
  in existing tests environements.
- Method's documentation is generated only if needed and uses Django's @cached_property decorator
- HTML documentation default template has been updated: Bootstrap 4.1.0 stable is now used, and the rendering has been
  improved.

**API Changes**

- Class RPCRequest has been removed and replaced by method ``execute_procedure(name, args, kwargs)`` in ``RPCHandler``
  class. This method contains common logic used to retrieve a RPC method, execute authentication predicates to make
  sure it can be run, execute the concrete method and return the result.
- HTML documentation content is not anymore marked as "safe" using ``django.utils.safestring.mark_safe()``. You
  have to use Django decorator ``safe`` in your template if you display this value.

**Settings**

- The ``kwargs`` dict passed to RPC methods can have customized keys (`#18`_). Set the following values:

  - ``settings.MODERNRPC_KWARGS_REQUEST_KEY``
  - ``settings.MODERNRPC_KWARGS_ENTRY_POINT_KEY``
  - ``settings.MODERNRPC_KWARGS_PROTOCOL_KEY``
  - ``settings.MODERNRPC_KWARGS_HANDLER_KEY``

to override dict keys and prevent conflicts with your own methods arguments.

**Other updates**

- Many units tests have been improved. Some tests with many calls to LiveServer have been splitted into shorter ones.

.. _#18: https://github.com/alorence/django-modern-rpc/issues/18

Release 0.10.0 (2017-12-06)
---------------------------
**Improvements**

- Logging system / error management

  - In case of error, current exception stacktrace is now passed to logger by default. This allows special handler like
    ``django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler`` or ``raven.handlers.logging.SentryHandler`` to use it to report more useful
    information (`#13`_)
  - Error messages have been rewritten to be consistent across all modules and classes
  - Decrease log verbosity: some ``INFO`` log messages now have ``DEBUG`` level (startup methods registration)

- Documentation has been updated

  - Added a page to explain how to configure RPC methods documentation generation, and add a note to explicitly
    state that ``markdown`` or ``docutils`` package must be installed if ``settings.MODERNRPC_DOC_FORMAT`` is set
    to non-empty value (`#16`_)
  - Added a page to list implemented system introspection methods
  - Added a bibliography page, to list all references used to write the library

- Default template for generated RPC methods documentation now uses Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta.2 (previously 4.0.0-alpha.5)

Release 0.9.0 (2017-10-03)
--------------------------
This is a major release with many improvements, protocol support and bug fixes. This version introduce an API break,
please read carefully.

**Improvements**

- Class ``RPCException`` and its subclasses now accept an additional ``data`` argument (`#10`_). This is used by JSON-RPC
  handler to report additional information to user in case of error. This data is ignored by XML-RPC handler.
- JSON-RPC: Batch requests are now supported (`#11`_)
- JSON-RPC: Named parameters are now supported (`#12`_)
- JSON-RPC: Notification calls are now supported. Missing `id` in payload is no longer considered as invalid, but
  is correectly handled. No HTTP response is returned in such case, according to the standard.
- XML-RPC: exception raised when serializing data to XML are now catched as ``InternalError`` and a clear error message

**API Changes**

- ``modernrpc.handlers.JSONRPC`` and ``modernrpc.handlers.XMLRPC`` constants have been moved and renamed. They
  become respectively ``modernrpc.core.JSONRPC_PROTOCOL`` and ``modernrpc.core.XMLRPC_PROTOCOL``
- ``RPCHandler`` class updated, as well as subclases ``XMLRPCHandler`` and ``JSONRPCHandler``.
  ``RPCHandler.parse_request()`` is now ``RPCHandler.process_request()``. The new method does not return a tuple
  ``(method_name, params)`` anymore. Instead, it executes the underlying RPC method using new class ``RPCRequest``.
  If you customized your handlers, please make sure you updated your code (if needed).

**Minor updates**

- Code has been improved to prepare future compatibility with Django 2.0

Release 0.8.1 (2017-10-02)
--------------------------

.. important::
    This version is a security fix. Upgrade is highly recommended

**Security fix**

- Authentication backend is correctly checked when executing method using ``system.multicall()``

Release 0.8.0 (2017-07-12)
--------------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed invalid HTML tag rendered from RPC Method documentation. Single new lines are converted to space since they
  are mostly used to limit docstrings line width. See pull request `#7`_, thanks to @adamdonahue
- Signature of ``auth.set_authentication_predicate`` has been fixed so it can be used as decorator_ (`#8`_).
  Thanks to @aplicacionamedida

.. _#8: https://github.com/alorence/django-modern-rpc/issues/8

Release 0.7.1 (2017-06-24)
--------------------------

**Minor fix**

- Removed useless settings variable introduced in last 0.7.0 release. Logging capabilities are now enabled by simply
  configuring a logger for ``modernrpc.*`` modules, using Django variable ``LOGGING``. The documentation_ has been
  updated accordingly.

Release 0.7.0 (2017-06-24)
--------------------------

**Improvement**

- Default logging behavior has changed. The library will not output any log anymore, unless
  ``MODERNRPC_ENABLE_LOGGING`` is set to True. See documentation_ for more information

.. _documentation: http://django-modern-rpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/tips_and_tricks.html#enable-logging

Release 0.6.0 (2017-05-13)
--------------------------

**Performance Improvements**

- Django cache system was previously used to store the list of available methods in the current project. This was
  useless, and caused issues with some cache systems (`#5`_).
  Use of cache system has been removed. The list of RPC methods is computed when the application is
  started and kept in memory until it is stopped.

.. _#5: https://github.com/alorence/django-modern-rpc/issues/5


Release 0.5.2 (2017-04-18)
--------------------------

**Improvements**

- HTTP Basic Authentication backend: User instance is now correctly stored in current request after successful
  authentication (`#4`_)
- Unit testing with Django 1.11 is now performed against release version (Beta and RC are not tested anymore)
- Various Documentation improvements

.. _#4: https://github.com/alorence/django-modern-rpc/issues/4

Release 0.5.1 (2017-03-25)
--------------------------

**Improvements**

- When RPC methods are registered, if a module file contains errors, a python warning is produced. This ensure the
  message will be displayed even if the logging system is not configured in a project (`#2`_)
- Python 2 strings standardization. Allow to configure an automatic conversion of incoming strings, to ensure they have
  the same type in RPC method, no matter what protocol was used to call it. Previously, due to different behavior
  between JSON and XML deserializers, strings were received as ``str`` when method was called via XML-RPC and as
  ``unicode`` with JSON-RPC. This standardization process is disabled by default, and can be configured for the whole
  project or for specific RPC methods.
- Tests are performed against Django 1.11rc1
- ``modernrpc.core.register_method()`` function was deprecated since version 0.4.0 and has been removed.

.. _#2: https://github.com/alorence/django-modern-rpc/issues/2

Release 0.5.0 (2017-02-18)
--------------------------

**Improvements**

- Typo fixes
- JSON-RPC 2.0 standard explicitly allows requests without 'params' member. This doesn't produce error anymore.
- Setting variable ``MODERNRPC_XML_USE_BUILTIN_TYPES`` is now deprecated in favor of
  ``MODERNRPC_XMLRPC_USE_BUILTIN_TYPES``
- Unit tests are now performed with python 3.6 and Django 1.11 alpha, in addition to supported environment already
  tested. This is a first step to full support for these environments.
- HTTP "Basic Auth" support: it is now possible to define RPC methods available only to specific users. The control can
  be done on various user attributes: group, permission, superuser status, etc.
  Authentication backend can be extended to support any method based on incoming request.

Release 0.4.2 (2016-11-20)
--------------------------

**Improvements**

- Various performance improvements
- Better use of logging system (python builtin) to report errors & exceptions from library and RPC methods
- Rewritten docstring parser. Markdown and reStructured formatters are still supported to generate HTML documentation
  for RPC methods. They now have unit tests to validate their behavior.
- @rpc_method decorator can be used with or without parenthesis (and this feature is tested)
- System methods have been documented

Release 0.4.1 (2016-11-17)
--------------------------

**Improvements**

- Method arguments documentation keep the same order as defined in docstring
- API change: ``MODERNRPC_ENTRY_POINTS_MODULES`` setting have been renamed to ``MODERNRPC_METHODS_MODULES``.
- A simple warning is displayed when ``MODERNRPC_METHODS_MODULES`` is not set, instead of a radical
  ``ImproperlyConfigured`` exception.
- Some traces have been added to allow debugging in the module easily. It uses the builtin logging framework.

Release 0.4.0 (2016-11-17)
--------------------------

**API Changes**

- New unified way to register methods. Documentation in progress
- XMl-RPC handler will now correctly serialize and unserialize None values by default. This behavior can be
  configured using ``MODERNRPC_XMLRPC_ALLOW_NONE`` setting.

**Bugfix**

- When django use a persistent cache (Redis, memcached, etc.), ensure the registry is up-to-date
  with current sources at startup

Release 0.3.2 (2016-10-26)
--------------------------

**Bugfix**

- Include missing templates in pypi distribution packages

- Many tests added

Release 0.3.0 (2016-10-18)
--------------------------

**API Changes**

- Settings variables have been renamed to limit conflicts with other libraries. In the future, all settings will have
  the same prefix.

  * ``JSONRPC_DEFAULT_DECODER`` becomes ``MODERNRPC_JSON_DECODER``
  * ``JSONRPC_DEFAULT_ENCODER`` becomes ``MODERNRPC_JSON_ENCODER``

  See https://github.com/alorence/django-modern-rpc/blob/master/modernrpc/conf/default_settings.py for more details
- Many other settings added, to make the library more configurable. See
  http://django-modern-rpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage/settings.html
