## Updating the Models
* This project makes use of [Swagger API Models](https://app.swaggerhub.com/)
* In Swagger, use the [swagger.yml](./properly_model_python/models/swagger.yml) to recreate the models.
* Configure the export settings:
    * Click the `Export` button in the top right.
    * Click `Codegen Options`.
    * Go to the `Servers` > `python-flask` section.
    * Set the `packageName` option to `properly_model_python`.
    * Click the `Save Options` button. 
* Export the models:
    * Click the `Export` button in the top right.
    * Select `Server Stub` > `python-flask`.
    * Save the zip file from Swagger.
* Copy the model files into the project:
    * Unzip the downloaded file.
    * From the unzipped content, copy to this project the following files: 
    ```
    ./python-flask-server-generated/properly_model_python/models/model_property.py
    ./python-flask-server-generated/properly_model_python/models/sold_property.py
    ./python-flask-server-generated/properly_model_python/models/swagger.yml
    ```
    * **Do not update** the following files because we have put custom code in them:
    ```
    ./python-flask-server-generated/properly_model_python/models/base_model_.py

    ```
