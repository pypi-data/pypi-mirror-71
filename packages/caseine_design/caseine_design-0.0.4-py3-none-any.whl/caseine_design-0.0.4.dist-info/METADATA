# Caseine Design Python support

The VPL Design Plugin allows an educator to create moodle VPL that may be prepared and pushed on 
a moodle instance using a command line.

To handle python labs, the VPL Design Plugin make uses of python decorations that have no 
python level semantics, but may be used by the VPL Design Plugin command line to prepare the lab 
before upload.

This plugin has been created mainly for the caseine.org platform, but may be used for other Moddle
instances with the VPL tool.
