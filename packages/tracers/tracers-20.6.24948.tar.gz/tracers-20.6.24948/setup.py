`@trace` decorator (which internally handles async/sync cases)\n- It's **Thread-safe**, **Async-safe**, **Process-safe** and **Context-safe**\n  - Accurate results in any scenario\n  - No worries about leaking, bleeding, corrupting, or locking stuff into other\n    code\n- Introduces **zero overhead** in production!\n  - The `@trace` decorator accepts a `do_trace` parameter\n    that you can dynamically set to `True` of `False` to differentiate\n    testing environments from production environments\n- It's **easy to deploy**\n  - No external dependencies!\n- It's easy to pin-point performance problems:\n  - Gives you the total execution time in seconds and **%**\n  - Allows you to identify points in time where your **async** event loop got blocked\n- Allows you to measure monotonic (wall time), process time, and thread time out-of-the box\n- Profiles without using dirty introspection stuff\n  - The main code is just 50 lines long, pretty high level, go and read it :)\n\n# Quick Introduction\n\nLet's start with a very basic example:\n\n```py\nimport time\nfrom dateutil.parser import parse\n\n\ndef example():\n    time.sleep(2.0)\n    your_business_logic('Sat Oct 11')\n\n\ndef your_business_logic(date: str):\n    parse(date)\n    time.sleep(1.0)\n\n\nexample()\n```\n\nTracing its flow and gathering profiling information is a matter of\ndecorating your functions:\n\n```diff\n--- a/examples/without_tracers.py\n+++ b/examples/with_tracers.py\n@@ -1,15 +1,18 @@\n import time\n from dateutil.parser import parse\n+from tracers.function import trace\n\n\n+@trace\n def example():\n     time.sleep(2.0)\n     your_business_logic('Sat Oct 11')\n\n\n+@trace\n def your_business_logic(date: str):\n     parse(date)\n     time.sleep(1.0)\n\n\n example()\n```\n\nIf you run it, all the functions you decorated will be traced\nand you'll have metrics of the execution flow:\n\n```\nðŸ›ˆ  Finished transaction: ce72c9dbe3d64e4cb43714fb87738ac4, 3.00 seconds\n\n  #    Timestamp      %     Total    Nested Call Chain\n\n     1     0.00s 100.0%     3.00s    âœ“ example()\n     2     2.00s  33.4%     1.00s    Â¦   âœ“ your_business_logic(date: str)\n```\n\nFrom the output you can conclude:\n- executing function *example* took a total of *3.0* seconds to complete\n- function *example* represents *100%* of your code time\n- function *example* called function: *your_business_logic*\n- function *your_business_logic* took *1.0* seconds out of the *3.0* seconds\n  the function *example* needed to complete\n- function *your_business_logic* represents *33.4%* of your execution time\n- There is *66.6%* of execution time\n  that we've not instrumented... yet!\n\nTracing code is not limited to your own code.\nYou can trace any **callable object** including **third party packages**,\n**Python's standard library**, and almost anything\n\nThe level of detail is up to you!\n\n\n```diff\n--- a/examples/with_tracers.py\n+++ b/examples/with_detailed_tracers.py\n@@ -1,18 +1,18 @@\n import time\n from dateutil.parser import parse\n from tracers.function import trace\n\n\n @trace\n def example():\n-    time.sleep(2.0)\n+    trace(time.sleep)(2.0)\n     your_business_logic('Sat Oct 11')\n\n\n @trace\n def your_business_logic(date: str):\n-    parse(date)\n-    time.sleep(1.0)\n+    trace(parse)(date)\n+    trace(time.sleep)(1.0)\n\n\n example()\n```\n\n```\nðŸ›ˆ  Finished transaction: 10b3878b12e647c1b326a9c55f954537, 3.00 seconds\n\n  #    Timestamp      %     Total    Nested Call Chain\n\n     1     0.00s 100.0%     3.00s    âœ“ example()\n     2     0.00s  66.6%     2.00s    Â¦   âœ“ time.sleep(...)\n     3     2.00s  33.4%     1.00s    Â¦   âœ“ your_business_logic(date: str)\n     4     2.00s   0.0%     0.00s    Â¦   Â¦   âœ“ dateutil.parser._parser.parse(timestr, parserinfo=None, **kwargs)\n     5     2.00s  33.3%     1.00s    Â¦   Â¦   âœ“ time.sleep(...)\n```\n\n# Installation\n\nWe are hosted on **PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/tracers\n\nJust run: `pip install tracers`\nor use the package manager you like the most\n\n# Examples\n\nCheck them out in the\n[examples](https://github.com/kamadorueda/tracers/tree/master/examples)\nfolder\n",
