 nti_sphinx_questions
======================

A sphinx extension providing two directives intended to be useful
during early phases of a project (e.g., requirement gathering):

``.. question::`` is a note-like environment to write an unresolved
question.

``.. questionlist::`` produces a hyperlinked collection of all such
questions found in the Sphinx document set.
