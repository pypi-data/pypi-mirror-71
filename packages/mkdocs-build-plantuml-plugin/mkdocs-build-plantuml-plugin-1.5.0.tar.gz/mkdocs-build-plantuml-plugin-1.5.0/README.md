# MkDocs-Build-Plantuml-Plugin

This plugin builds your Plantuml image files with `mkdocs serve` automatically.

My intend was, that I do not like inline diagrams and stumbled upon issues like non-working `!includes`.

**Note**: if you want inline diagrams in your Markdown files like

````markdown
```plantuml
Alice -> Bob
```
````

this is plugin is _not_ the right one. Please check out [plantuml-markdown](https://github.com/mikitex70/plantuml-markdown) which does exactly that.

## Prerequesites

You need to have installed

- Python3
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
- Java for Plantuml (if running locally)
- [Plantuml](https://plantuml.com) (if running locally)
- This plugin (needs httplib2 for server rendering)

On OSX you can install plantuml with homebrew which puts a plantuml executable in `/usr/local/bin/plantuml`.

## Installation

`pip3 install mkdocs-build-plantuml-plugin`

## Usage

### Plugin Settings

In `mkdocs.yml` add this plugin section (depicted are the default values):

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - build_plantuml:
      render: "server" # or "local" for local rendering
      bin_path: "/usr/local/bin/plantuml" # ignored when render: server
      server: "http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml" # offical plantuml server
      output_format: "svg" # or "png"
      diagram_root: "docs/diagrams" # should reside under docs_dir
      output_folder: "out"
      input_folder: "src"
      input_extensions: "" # comma separated list of extensions to parse, by default every file is parsed
```

It is recommended to use the `server` option, which is much faster than `local`.

### Example folder structure

This would result in this directory layout:

```python
docs/                         # the default MkDocs docs_dir directory
  diagrams/
    include/                  # for include files like theme.puml etc (optional, won't be generated)
    out/                      # the generated images, which can be included in your md files
      subdir1/file1.svg       # you can organise your diagrams in subfolders, see below
      file.svg
    src/                      # the Plantuml sources
      subdir1/file1.puml
      subdir2/
      file.puml
mkdocs.yml                    # mkdocs configuration file

```

When starting with `mkdocs serve`, it will create all diagrams initially.

Afterwards, it checks if the `*.puml` (or other ending) file has a newer timestamp than the corresponding file in out. If so, it will generate a new image (works also with includes). This way, it wonâ€˜t take long until the site reloads and does not get into a loop.

### Including generated images

Inside your `index.md` or any other Markdown file you can then reference any created image as usual:

```markdown
# My MkDocs Document

## Example Plantuml Images

![file](diagrams/out/file.svg)

![file1](diagrams/out/subdir1/file1.svg)
```
## Dark Mode Support with >=1.4 (prefers-color-scheme)

Since Version 1.4 this plugin can support dark mode when rendering with `server`. 

**Note: Not in local mode, only server rendering mode**

1. Grab a general (ie. for [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)) dark mode support css file (i.e. from [henrywhitaker3/mkdocs-material-dark-theme](https://github.com/henrywhitaker3/mkdocs-material-dark-theme)) for your theme
1. Enable theme support in this plugin:
   
        - build_plantuml:
            [...]
            theme_enabled: true
            theme_folder: "include/themes"
            theme_light: "light.puml"
            theme_dark: "dark.puml"
2. You have to provide two puml theme files, ie mydarkmode.puml and mylightmode.puml
3. In the out directory a `<file>.<ext>` will be created and additionally a `<file>_dark.<ext>`
4. Insert your images in markdown with `![file](diagrams/out/file.svg#darkable)` (this selector is then used in the [JS file](example/docs/javascript/images_dark.js) to know which images have to be exchanged)
5. provide [`extra_javascript`](./example/docs/javascript/images_dark.js) file which handles the switch

You can find an example in the [example folder](./example/)

### Example Output

![DarkMode](./swich_dark_mode.gif)

## Known restrictions

- If you use `!include`s and the `render: "server"` option, this plugin merges those files manually. If there are any issues or side effects because of that, please open a ticket.
- Dark mode / theme support is currently only available in server rendering mode.
