Changelog
=========

V6.1.2: MC, Oxford, 20 June 2020
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: Fixed input ``ml`` being ignored. Thanks to Sabine
      Thater (univie.ac.at) and Takafumi Tsukui (grad.nao.ac.jp) for reporting.
    - ``jam_axi_rms``: I reduced the interpolation error before the PSF
      convolution for all the rotines in the ``legacy`` sub-folder, as already
      implemented in the new ``jam_axi_proj``. Thanks to Takafumi Tsukui
      (grad.nao.ac.jp) for reporting differences.
    - ``jam_axi_intr``: Request input ``data = [sigR, sigz, sigphi, vrms_phi]``
      instead of ``data = [sigR, sigz, sigphi, vphi]``.
    - ``jam_axi_intr``: exclude ``sigphi`` from ``ml`` fitting. These two
      changes make the fitted ``ml`` strictly independent of the adopted
      tangential anisotropy ``gamma``.

V6.0.1: MC, Oxford, 23 April 2020
    - Fixed ``model`` output when fitting ``ml``.
      Thanks to Selina Nitschai (mpia-hd.mpg.de) for reporting.

V6.0.0: MC, Oxford, 22 April 2020
    - Major changes to the whole ``jampy`` package: from this version
      I include the new spherically-aligned solution of the Jeans 
      equations from Cappellari (2020, MNRAS).
    - Two new functions ``jam_axi_intr`` and ``jam_axi_proj``
      now provide either the intrinsic or the projected moments,
      respectively, for both the spherically-aligned and 
      cylindrically-aligned JAM solutions.
    - I moved the previous procedures ``jam_axi_rms``, ``jam_axi_vel``
      and ``jam_sph_rms`` to the ``jampy.legacy`` folder.

      the symmetric proper motion dispersion tensor (as in note 5 of the paper).
