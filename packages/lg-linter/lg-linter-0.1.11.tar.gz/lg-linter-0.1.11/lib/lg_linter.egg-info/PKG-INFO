Description: # LG-Linter
        ![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/lgulich/lg-linter/workflows/Upload%20Python%20Package/badge.svg?branch=master)
        
        A simple pre-commit linter for bash, python and c++.
        
        ## Installation
        Make sure you have `pip3`, `clang-format` and `shellcheck` installed. If not you can install them with
        ```sh
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y python3-pip clang-format shellcheck
        ```
        Next install the linter with
        ```sh
        pip3 install lg-linter
        ```
        **Note:** This will install / overwrite the linter config files in your home directory.
        
        ## How to use
        Inside your git repo run
        ```sh
        init_lg_linter
        ```
        The linter is now active and will be run before every commit.
        If you want to remove the linter from your repo use
        ```
        deinit_lg_linter
        ```
        
        **Pro Tip:** If the linter complains about stuff which clearly is wrong you can override him with
        ```
        git commit --no-verify
        ```
        Use with care, with great power comes great responsibility!
