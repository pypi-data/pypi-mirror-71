=====================
jupyterhub-chameleon
=====================

**Chameleon customizations for JupyterHub, all in one module.**

This module contains several extensions and congurations relevant for Chameleon:

* A custom authenticator that handles migrating users from the legacy
  Keystone-based authenticator to a new OpenID-based authenticator (using
  Chameleon's Keycloak deployment)
* A Docker-based spawner preconfigured with volumes backed by RBD and special
  handling of user scratch directories vs. experimental (ephemeral) mounts
* An experiment import handler, which is used to craft a special spawn request
  that pulls code either from GitHub or a Zenodo deposition to create an
  ephemeral experimental environment
* A managed service that can refresh a user's access tokens

Installation
============

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install jupyterhub-chameleon

Usage
=====

The ``install_extension`` function is the easiest way to ensure everything is
configured properly, as it will make most of the adjustments to the stock
configuration for you.

.. code-block:: python

   import jupyterhub_chameleon

   c = get_config()
   jupyterhub_chameleon.install_extension(c)

   # Configure JupyterHub further as needed
