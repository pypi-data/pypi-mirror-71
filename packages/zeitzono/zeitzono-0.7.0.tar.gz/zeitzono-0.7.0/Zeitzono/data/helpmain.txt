city list manipulation commands
-------------------------------
C - clear list of cities
p - delete (pop) bottom city in list
P[index] - delete (pop) given city
, - rotate city list down
. - rotate city list up
/ - rotate (swap) last 2 cities
' - rotate down last 3 cities
; - rotate down last 4 cities
] - sort city list by UTC offset ([ to reverse sort)
u - undo city list manipulation (up to 10 operations can be undone)
r - redo city list manipulation

- - add random city to list      (useful to help learn list manipulation)
= - add 10 random cities to list (useful to help learn list manipulation)
 

time zone commands
------------------
L - set base timezone to local machine timezone
z - set base timezone to bottom city
Z[index] - set base timezone to given city

time manipulation commands
--------------------------
n   - set base time to current time (see wall clock mode below)
N   - NLP mode: parse a human readable date/time (see below)
0   - zero out second/minutes in base time
s/S - add/subtract Seconds to base time
m/M - add/subtract Minutes to base time
f/F - add/subtract Fifteen minutes to base time
h/H - add/subtract Hours to base time
x/X - add/subtract siX hours to base time
d/D - add/subtract Days to base time
w/W - add/subtract Weeks to base time
o/O - add/subtract mOnths to base time
y/Y - add/subtract Years to base time

wall clock mode (current time)
------------------------------
Upon startup, or when "n" is selected to display the current time, the
program will go into wall clock mode. The base time and all cities on
the main screen will show and update the current time in realtime.
There is a "[C]" displayed next to the base time to indicate this.

If a time manipulation key is entered or if using a parsed date from NLP
mode, wall clock mode is turned off. Press "n" again to resume showing
the current time.

NLP Mode
--------
When in NLP mode ('N'), you can enter any human readable date/time which
Zeitzono will parse and apply to the base time. Examples:

    "today", "last Friday at 4am", "july 4th, 1776 at 9am", etc.

If the entry is successfully parsed, you will be exited out of NLP mode
and the parsed date/time will be applied to the base.

If the entry cannot be successfully parsed, you will be returned to the
NLP prompt.

To exit out of NLP mode without entering a string, hit enter at a blank
NLP prompt.
