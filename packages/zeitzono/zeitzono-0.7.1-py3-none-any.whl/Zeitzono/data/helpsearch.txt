SEARCHING
---------
The purpose of Zeitzono's city search is to find cities as quickly as
possible.

Search: TERM1 [TERM2 [TERM3]] ...

Entering a search term will search cities that match that term.

Entering more search terms will search cities for match all given
patterns. (The terms will be logically AND'ed together.)

If any search term is prefixed with a single quote ('), that pattern
will search only against city names, not alternative names (see EXAMPLES
section below).

If any search term is prefixed with a colon (:), that pattern will
search against the name of the country or the admin1 (usually state or
province) or admin2 (usually county) names.


EXAMPLES
--------
A search for "peter" will match a number of cities that contain that
name. A search for "peter boro" will match two cities named Peterborough
in the UK and Canada. A search for "peter boro :can" will match only the
Canadian city by that name.

Searching for a city name will match against the city name as well as
alternative names for that city. So a search for "bombay" will match
"Mumbai".

Sometimes this can lead to surprising results: a search for "apple" will
bring up New York City as the top result, because "The Big Apple" is an
alternate name for NYC. Use the quote character (ie. 'apple) to suppress
searching against alternate names.


SELECTING A CITY
----------------
Search results are ordered such that the city with the largest
population will be at the bottom.

Hitting Enter will select the city at the bottom of the search results.

If the search results return multiple cities, selecting 0-9 will select
that particular city, where 0 selects the bottom city, and 1 selects the
city above it, etc.

Hitting Escape at any time will cancel the city search and return you to
the main window.
