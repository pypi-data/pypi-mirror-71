# Installation
Install from pip:

`pip install tributary`

or from source

`python setup.py install`

# Stream Types
Tributary offers several kinds of streams:

## Streaming
These are synchronous, reactive data streams, built using asynchronous python generators. They are designed to mimic complex event processors in terms of event ordering.

## Functional
These are functional streams, built by currying python functions (callbacks). 

## Lazy
These are lazily-evaluated python streams, where outputs are propogated only as inputs change. They are implemented as directed acyclic graphs.

# Examples
- [Streaming](docs/examples/streaming/streaming.md): In this example, we construct a variety of forward propogating reactive graphs.
- [Lazy](docs/examples/lazy/lazy.md): In this example, we construct a variety of lazily-evaluated directed acyclic computation graphs. 

# Graph Visualization
You can visualize the graph with Graphviz. All streaming and lazy nodes support a `graphviz` method.

Streaming and lazy nodes also support [ipydagred3](https://github.com/timkpaine/ipydagred3) for live update monitoring.

## Streaming

Here green indicates executing, yellow indicates stalled for backpressure, and red indicates that `StreamEnd` has been propogated (e.g. stream has ended).

## Lazy
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timkpaine/tributary/master/docs/img/lazy/dagred3.gif)

Here green indicates executing, and red indicates that the node is dirty. Note the the determination if a node is dirty is also done lazily (we can check with `isDirty` whcih will update the node's graph state.

# Transforms
## Modulate
- Delay - Streaming wrapper to delay a stream
- Apply - Streaming wrapper to apply a function to an input stream
- Window - Streaming wrapper to collect a window of values
- Unroll - Streaming wrapper to unroll an iterable stream
