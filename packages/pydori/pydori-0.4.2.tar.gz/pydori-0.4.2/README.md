[![PyPI version fury.io](https://badge.fury.io/py/pydori.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydori/)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WiIIiamTang/pydori.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WiIIiamTang/pydori)
  

A python wrapper for the bandori.party and bandori.ga public APIs.

  

# Info
Although both bandori.party and bandori database provide extensive public bang dream api's, there is currently not much documentation to help navigate through them. This package attempts to simplify accessing the various endpoints they provide. Not everything is available through this package, but the main ones should be here. This package consolidates both the bandori.party and bandori.ga APIs - for example, songs are not available through the bandori.party API, so all music-related data is gotten from bandori database.
  

# Installation

Use pip to install:

``` pip install pydori ```

  

# Example
This example instantiates a BandoriApi object, gets a card by ID, and displays the card's name.
```python
import pydori

b = pydori.BandoriApi()
result = b.get_cards(id=[511])
card = result[0]

print(card.name)
```

Here we get the current event and display the start and end times:
```python
from pydori import BandoriApi as api

b = api()
current = b.get_current_event()

print(current.get_start_date())
print(current.get_end_date())
```

Pydori accepts filters for the objects, as a dictionary. If a list of ids are present, then the filters will be ignored completely. This example shows how to get all songs by the band "Roselia".

```python
import pydori

b = pydori.BandoriApi()
roselia_songs = b.get_songs(id=[], filters={'bandName' : 'Roselia'})
```

## BandoriApi
 ```pydori.BandoriApi(BandoriLoader)```
 
A class that talks to the bandori APIs. All functions that should be used are in this class.

| Attributes | Description                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| URL_PARTY  | A url to the bandori.party api             |
| URL_GA     | a url to the bandori.ga api                |
| URL_GA_RES | a url to the bandori database resource api |
| region     |                                            |

### Parameters
- region(Optional[str]) - Region used for the bandori database api. Other options include 'jp/', 'tw/' (not tested), 'kr/' (not tested)

### Functions
#### ```get_cards(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of ```Card``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all cards will be returned.

#### ```get_members(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of ```Member``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all members will be returned.

#### ```get_events(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of ```Event``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all members will be returned.

#### ```get_current_event()```
Returns the current event as an ```Event``` object in a list (it makes an internal call to ```get_events```). The current event is provided by the bandori database api, but the event data itself is from bandori.party.

#### ```get_costumes(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of ```Costume``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all costumes will be returned.

#### ```get_items(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of ```Item``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all items will be returned.

#### ```get_areaitems(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of ```AreaItem``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all areaitems will be returned.

#### ```get_assets(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a dict where the keys are the different subtypes of ```Asset```, and the values are a list of those objects. If the input list is empty, all assets will be returned.

Even when there is only one asset queried, a full dict will be returned - just with empty lists in some of the values.


#### ```get_bands(filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of all bands as ```Band``` objects. You cannot get a specific band from id. This is region sensitive.

#### ```get_songs(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of ```Song``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all songs will be returned. This is region sensitive.

#### ```get_gachas(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
Returns a list of ```Gacha```objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all gachas will be returned. This is region sensitive.

#### ```get_all()```
Returns all possible objects from the api as a dictionary. It is separated by object type.


### Using filters
A function can accept an optional "filters" parameter. If the list with ids is not empty, filters will be ignored. You are able to filter by the objects' attributes. The keys should be the attribute you want to filter, the values are what you want. For example,
```python
c = api.get_cards(filters={'i_attribute' : 'Cool'})
```
will get all cards with the attribute *Cool*. For a list of all attributes you can filter by, see the **BandoriObject** section below.
The keys of the dict can be any attribute of the objects (as a string), and the return value will be a list of objects with the desired attributes, provided that the value in the dict is valid. Filters are case sensitive (you need to put the exact, correct value).

**The filter attributes may have different format. For example, you can access a Card's rarity by doing : ```Card.rarity```
but in order to filter by rarity, I would have to do something like : ```get_cards(filters={'i_rarity' : 4}```
In other words, the _keys for filters_ are not always exactly the same as the attribute name. When _it is different_, the correct filter keyword will be indicated.**


## BandoriObject
```pydori.base_objects.BandoriObject(data : dict, id_name = 'id', region = 'en/')```

Bandori objects are classes that represent data retrieved from the api. They are used to have quick access to certain attributes, and provide helpful methods on the data. They can be sorted by id. **They should not be normally instantiated (unless for debugging) and are meant as outputs from BandoriApi.** All BandoriObjects have the follow attributes:

| Attributes | Description                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| URL_PARTY  | A url to the bandori.party api                              |
| URL_GA     | a url to the bandori.ga api                                 |
| URL_GA_RES | a url to the bandori database resource api                  |
| id         | The object's id                                             |
| data       | The original dict of the object's information from the api. |
| region     |                                                             |
| bl         | An instance of BandoriLoader                                |


_Notes:_

*Region select only works on certain methods, namely, Song, Gacha, Band. See below*

*Some attributes may have a null value. The objects may not work with their intended functions. Check before using.*

*The bandori.party api is used to retrieve data for most classes. Only Songs, Bands, and Gachas class make use of the bandori database api.*

### Parameters
- data([dict]) - A python dictionary containing the data for the class

- id_name(Optional[str]) - The string to use when searching for the id in the dict.

- region(Optional[str]) - Region used for the bandori database api. Other options include 'jp/', 'tw/' (not tested), 'kr/' (not tested)

## BandoriLoader
```pydori.bandori_loader.BandoriLoader(region = 'en/')```

BandoriApi inherits from this class. **It is only meant for internal use, and its purpose is to make api calls to bandori.party and bandori.database and return the result as dictionaries or lists.** It should not be normally instantiated, but is useful sometimes for debugging.
