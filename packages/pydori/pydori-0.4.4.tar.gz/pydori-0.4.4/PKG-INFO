        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WiIIiamTang/pydori.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WiIIiamTang/pydori)
          
        
        A python package to provide easier access to the bandori party and bandori database public APIs.
        
          
        
        # Info
        Both bandori.party and bandori database provide extensive public bang dream apis. This package attempts to simplify accessing the various endpoints they provide.
        
        This primarly uses the bandori.party api. When it was not possible to find a certain endpoint in bandori.party, the bandori database api was used instead (This is the case with all music, gacha, and more).
        
        
         - [x] Bandori party API endpoints: 100%
         - [ ] Bandori database API endpoints: Only songs, gacha, bands currently
         - [x] Endpoint documentation: done
          
        
        # Installation
        
        Use pip to install:
        
        ``` pip install pydori ```
        
        
        # Usage
        
        Working with pydori is done through the ```BandoriApi``` class. Create an instance of the class (and indicate your region if you're going to be using the bandori database api) and start using the functions provided.
        
        The syntax for the class functions is simple: ```get_``` followed by whatever type of bang dream content you want.
        
        ```python
        pydori.BandoriApi().get_cards()
        ```
        This gets the cards. See the documentation for the full list of things you can request.
        
        Functions also have optional arguments: **id** and **filters**. ```id``` is a list of integers representing the ids of the objects you want. ```filters``` is a dictionary of filters to use when searching. See the documentation on filters for more details.
        
        Note again that this relies mainly on the bandori.party api. So Cards, Members, etc. all represent data from bandori party. I've noticed that some of the data - specifically, card names - does not match the english server data. In the future, there may be the option to have the choice to use only one of the apis and switch back and forth.
        
        # Example
        This example instantiates a BandoriApi object, gets a card by ID, and displays the card's name.
        ```python
        import pydori
        
        b = pydori.BandoriApi()
        result = b.get_cards(id=[511])
        card = result[0]
        
        print(card.name)
        ```
        
        Here we get the current event and display the start and end times:
        ```python
        from pydori import BandoriApi as api
        
        b = api()
        current = b.get_current_event()
        
        print(current.get_start_date())
        print(current.get_end_date())
        ```
        
        Pydori accepts filters for the objects, as a dictionary. This example shows how to get all songs by the band "Roselia".
        
        ```python
        import pydori
        
        b = pydori.BandoriApi()
        roselia_songs = b.get_songs(id=[], filters={'bandName' : 'Roselia'})
        ```
        
        # Documentation
        
        ## BandoriApi
         ```pydori.BandoriApi(region = 'en/')```
         
        A class that talks to the bandori APIs. All functions that should be used are in this class.
        
        | Attributes | Description                                |
        |------------|--------------------------------------------|
        | URL_PARTY  | A url to the bandori.party api             |
        | URL_GA     | a url to the bandori.ga api                |
        | URL_GA_RES | a url to the bandori database resource api |
        | region     |                                            |
        
        ### Parameters
        - region(Optional[str]) - Region used for the bandori database api. Other options include 'jp/', 'tw/' (not tested), 'kr/' (not tested)
        
        ### Functions
        #### ```get_cards(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of ```Card``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all cards will be returned.
        
        #### ```get_members(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of ```Member``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all members will be returned.
        
        #### ```get_events(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of ```Event``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all members will be returned.
        
        #### ```get_current_event()```
        Returns the current event as an ```Event``` object in a list (it makes an internal call to ```get_events```). The current event is provided by the bandori database api, but the event data itself is from bandori.party.
        
        #### ```get_costumes(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of ```Costume``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all costumes will be returned.
        
        #### ```get_items(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of ```Item``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all items will be returned.
        
        #### ```get_areaitems(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of ```AreaItem``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all areaitems will be returned.
        
        #### ```get_assets(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a dict where the keys are the different subtypes of ```Asset```, and the values are a list of those objects. If the input list is empty, all assets will be returned.
        
        Even when there is only one asset queried, a full dict will be returned - just with empty lists in some of the values.
        
        
        #### ```get_bands(filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of all bands as ```Band``` objects. You cannot get a specific band from id. This is region sensitive.
        
        #### ```get_songs(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of ```Song``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all songs will be returned. This is region sensitive.
        
        #### ```get_gachas(id : list = [], filters : dict = {})```
        Returns a list of ```Gacha```objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all gachas will be returned. This is region sensitive.
        
        #### ```get_all()```
        Returns all possible objects from the api as a dictionary. It is separated by object type.
        
        
        ### Using filters
        A function can accept an optional "filters" parameter. You are able to filter by the objects' attributes. The keys should be the attribute you want to filter, the values are what you want. For example,
        ```python
        c = api.get_cards(filters={'i_attribute' : 'Cool'})
        ```
        will get all cards with the attribute *Cool*. For a list of all attributes you can filter by, see the **BandoriObject** section below.
        
        #### Key-value pairs in a filter
        The keys of the dict can be any attribute of the objects (as a string), and the return value will be a list of objects with the desired attributes, provided that the value in the dict is valid. Filters are case sensitive (you need to put the exact, correct value).
        
        **The filter attributes may have different format. For example, you can access a Card's rarity by doing : ```Card.rarity```
        but in order to *filter by rarity*, I would have to do something like : ```get_cards(filters={'i_rarity' : 4}```
        In other words, the _keys for filters_ are not always exactly the same as the attribute name. When _it is different_, the correct filter keyword will be indicated.**
        
        
        ## BandoriObject
        ```pydori.models.base.BandoriObject(data : dict, id_name = 'id', region = 'en/')```
        
        Bandori objects are classes that represent data retrieved from the api. They are used to have quick access to certain attributes, and provide helpful methods on the data. They can be sorted by id. **They should not be normally instantiated (unless for debugging) and are meant as outputs from BandoriApi.** All BandoriObjects have the follow attributes:
        
        | Attributes | Description                                                 |
        |------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
        | URL_PARTY  | A url to the bandori.party api                              |
        | URL_GA     | a url to the bandori.ga api                                 |
        | URL_GA_RES | a url to the bandori database resource api                  |
        | id         | The object's id                                             |
        | data       | The original dict of the object's information from the api. |
        | region     |                                                             |
        | bl         | An instance of BandoriLoader                                |
        
        
        _Notes:_
        
        *Region select only works on certain methods, namely, Song, Gacha, Band. See below*
        
        *Some attributes may have a null value. The objects may not work with their intended functions. Check before using.*
        
        *The bandori.party api is used to retrieve data for most classes. Only Songs, Bands, and Gachas class make use of the bandori database api.*
        
        ### Parameters
        - data([dict]) - A python dictionary containing the data for the class
        
        - id_name(Optional[str]) - The string to use when searching for the id in the dict.
        
        - region(Optional[str]) - Region used for the bandori database api. Other options include 'jp/', 'tw/' (not tested), 'kr/' (not tested)
        
        
        The following classes inherit from BandoriObject:

        ### ```Member(BandoriObject)```
        Represents a Bang Dream member with the following attributes:
        
        | Attributes    | Description                                                  | filter keyword (if different only) |
