Tagreader is a Python package for reading trend data from the OSIsoft
PI and Aspen Infoplus.21 IMS systems. It is intended to be easy to use,
and present as similar as possible interfaces to the backend historians.

Queries are performed using ODBC using proprietary drivers from Aspen
and OSIsoft, but code has been structured in such a way as to allow for
other interfaces, e.g. REST APIs, in the future. Stay tuned!

Tagreader outputs trend data as Pandas Dataframes, and uses the HDF5
file format to cache results.

## Requirements ##
* Python >= 3.6 with the following packages:
  * pandas >= 0.23
  * pytables
  * pyodbc
* PI ODBC driver and/or Aspen IP.21 SQLPlus ODBC driver
* Microsoft Windows (Sorry. This is due to the proprietary ODBC drivers for OSIsoft PI and Aspen IP.21)

## Installation ##
To install and/or upgrade:
```
pip install --upgrade tagreader
```

## Usage example ##
```
import tagreader
c = tagreader.IMSClient("mysource", "ip21")
print(c.search("mytag%"))
df = s.read_tags(["mytag_1", "mytag_2;with map"], "18.06.2020 08:00:00", "18.06.2020 09:00:00", 60)
```
