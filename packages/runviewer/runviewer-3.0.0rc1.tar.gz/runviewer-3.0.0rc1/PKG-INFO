Description: # runviewer
        
        
        The runviewer Python program allows you to visualise a shot compiled by labscript. runviewer is designed to show you what you have commanded the hardware to do throughout the experiment shot, by plotting traces of outputs and inputs. These traces are reverse engineered from the hardware instructions produced by labscript, and provide a faithful representation of what the hardware has been commanded to do.
