# bms-tree-modules

The package contains the generic building blocks for the period-based Banking Management Simulation Games developed by the Institue of Banking & Finance (University of Zurich, Switerland).

The package delivers the game building blocks: Node, Tree, Team, Config, Curves, Module.
These classes can be used to implement a simulation without having to setup the complete tree data structure logic from scratch.
The implementation can extend the class `Module` which takes JSON as input and allows to create a tree data structure recursively from it.
All manipulations of the tree should be implemented in the actual implementation/simulation class.

This package has been created as part of the Banking Management Simulation Game (BMS20) project at the Institue of Banking & Finance and Institute of Informatics (University of Zurich).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- pip
- pipenv

## Using the Library (in a Simulation)

### Installation

Run `pipenv install bms-tree-modules` or `pip install bms-tree-modules` to install the package.

### How to create a new simulation?

Create a new file in which you're going to implement the logic of the simulation.

```python
from bms-tree-modules.module import Module

class SimulationClassName(Module):
    def __init__(self, period_input):
        super().__init__(period_input)


with open("/path/to/json_input.json", "r") as file:
    # read file and load json string as dict
    period_input = json.loads(file.read())

    # create new simulation
    sim = SimulationClassName(period_input)
```

### JSON input format requriements

The Module class requires the `period_input` to be JSON and in the following format.
All parts described separately below need to be in the same input file.

#### Curve Configuration

```json
{
  "curve_assignments": [
    {
      // key how the curve shall be retrievable in your code
      "curve_slot_key": "KEY_USED_INTERNALLY_TO_RETRIEVE_THE_CURVE",
      "curve_assigned": {
        // The coefficients of the sensitivity curve
        // The curve will be create as a lambda function
        "coefficients": [0.12, 7.5, 200.0],
      }
    },
```

#### Team Input

For every team taking part in the period-based simulation, the `teams` array needs to contain a separate entry.

```json
"teams": [
    {
      "team_id": 0,
      "decisions": [
        // the decisions the teams made
        { "key": "LOANS_MARK_UP_RATING_A", "value": 0.01 },
      ],
      "tree_input": {
        "name": "root",
        "value": 0,
        "description": "Team0_RoundInput_PeriodTimestamp?",
        "children": [
          {
            "name": "BS",
            "description": "The Balance Sheet",
            "value": 0,
            "children": [
              {
```

##### Team Object

Every team object consists of:

- team_id: int
- decisions: List of Decision Objects
- tree_input: Node Object (root node)

##### Decision Object

Every decision objects consists of:

- key: string
- value: float

The keys must be the same across all teams and each team must contain all keys that exist.

##### Node Object

Every object inside the `tree_input` is a Node object which needs to contain the following:

- name: string
- value: float
- description: string
- children: List of other child nodes (or empty)

#### Leaf Node Configuration Values

For at least all leaf-nodes (nodes which don't have childern i.e. an empty children array), a node configuration object needs to be provided.

##### What is an effect?

An effect is a factor which influences how the value of a leaf-node is changed from state `t0` to state `t1` (i.e. the change from one period to the next).
A leaf-node can have many different effects.
The results of all effects are summed and added/subtracted from the leaf-nodes input value -> new value.

Each effect can have multiple configuration values -> these values are the same for all teams.
An example of a configuration value is the `CURVE` mapping which tells the simulation which sensitivity curve to use during the computation of the new effect value.
Others are, `MIN` (lower-limit), `MAX` (upper-limit), `WEIGHT` (contribution factor) which need to be considered when computing the effects value.

```json
  "config": [
    {
      "name": "BS_ACT_LOANS_RATING_A",
      "description": "Description of the configuration values",
      "effects": [
        {
          "name": "SERVICE_QUALITY",
          "values": [
            {
              "key": "MIN",
              "value": 0.0
            },
            {
              "key": "MAX",
              "value": 0.1
            },
            {
              "key": "WEIGHT",
              "value": 0.5
            },
            {
              "key": "CURVE",
              "value": "SERVICE_QUALITY_ASSET_SIDE"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
```

## Developing the Library

For developers wanting to extend this work, the following parts might give some insights.

### Installation Instructions

Run `pipenv install --dev` to install all dependencies
Run `pipenv shell` to enter the virtualenv created by pipenv for this project.

PS: if the installation doesn't work use `--pre` since some packages might only be in pre-release state.

### How to build a new release?

Make sure you're inside the previously created pipenv.

#### Create the build (package)

Run `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` which creates a `dist/` and `build` folder.

#### Upload the package

Run `python3 -m twine upload dist/*` to upload to the PyPi repository.

In order for the upload to work, you need to create an API token to access PyPi.
Use `__token__` for username and `pypi-...` as password.

PS: the credentails can also be stored inside a `$HOME/.pypirc` file.

```
[pypi]
  username = __token__
  password = pypi-...
```
