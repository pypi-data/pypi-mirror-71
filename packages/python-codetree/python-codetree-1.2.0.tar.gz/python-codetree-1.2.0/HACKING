Codetree Hacking
================

If you're trying to hack on codetree, you can run:

  $ python setup.py install --user

against a branch of codetree to install it into your $HOME/.local (you may
need to check that $HOME/.local/bin is on your $PATH)

See the [README](readme.html)'s FAQ for further tips/gotchas.

To build an updated version of the codetree package:

 1. Ensure the name of the directory you're using is "codetree" (debian
    packaging will look for this).
 2. Increment the version in ./setup.py
 3. `make deb-src`. If you need to rerun for some reason (missing dependencies,
     etc.), just re-run `debuild -S -sa -I.bzr` from the debian directory, as
     `make deb-src` will update the changelog again.
 4. Upload the source.changes file from a directory level above the Makefile:
    dput ppa:$MY-PPA/ppa codetree_$version_source.changes

If you want to test the code without manually specifying a virtualenv, tox can
be used:
 * tox -e <pep8|py27|py3>
