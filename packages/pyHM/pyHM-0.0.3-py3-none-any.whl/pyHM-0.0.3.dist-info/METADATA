Python Human Movements is a python package which imitates human movements.

## Installation

    $ pip install pyHM

## Getting Started

### Mouse
Importing the mouse object from the parent package.
```python
from pyHM import mouse

print(type(mouse))
```
```
>> <class 'mouse.Mouse'>
```

#### Mouse.move()
Have your mouse move across your screen to an `(x, y)` coordinate like a human would. 
```python
from pyHM import mouse

destination_x = 16
destination_y = 25

mouse.move(destination_x, destination_y)
```
```
>> *Your mouse cursor moves to (16, 25) as if it were a human*
```

You can also add a multiplier which will either speed-up or slow down the mouse movement depending on what you want.
The higher the number the slower the movement, you can also have floats such as `0.1337`.
```python
from pyHM import mouse

x = 5
y = 2

mouse.move(x, y, multiplier=10)
``` 
```
>> *Your mouse cursor moves to (5, 2) as if it were a human
    at about 10 times the speed*
```

### Mouse.get_current_position()
This will return your mouses current x and y coordinate.
```python
from pyHM import mouse

print(mouse.get_current_position())
```
```
>> (1954, 122)
```
