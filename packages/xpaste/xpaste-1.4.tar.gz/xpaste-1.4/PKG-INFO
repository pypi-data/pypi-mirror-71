        SYNOPSIS
        --------
        
        ::
        
            xpaste <<EOF
            This text will be pasted into a window of your choosing.
            EOF
        
        
        DESCRIPTION
        -----------
        
        *Some applications refuse to work with any of the three selection
        buffers that X/X11/Xorg has: the* **middle-mouse** *selection,*
        **secondary** *selection and the* **CTRL-(SHIFT-)V** *clipboard
        selection.*
        
        If you have to insert long or difficult to type text (generated
        passwords), not being able to *paste* can be troublesome.
        
        xpaste will read the text to paste from standard input, keep it in
        memory and wait for you to press ENTER.  When you do, it pastes the held
        text into the newly focused window.
        
        See this *before/after* example where the username is pasted into the
        SuperMicro ipmiview Java application that doesn't accept "paste" input
        through the middle-mouse or CTRL-V:
        
        .. image:: ./xpaste.png
        
        The pasting of text happens through "faked" keypress events.  And as you
        can see from the example, it works.
        
        **NOTE: xpaste does not work on Wayland because it disallows
        applications to meddle with other applications. However, you
        can start both applications under the Xwayland compatibility
        layer, e.g. from:** ``WAYLAND_DISPLAY= gnome-terminal``
