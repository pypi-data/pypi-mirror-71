Description: # pyspherical

        An implementation of the fast spin-weighted spherical harmonic transform methods of McEwan and Wiaux (2011) [1], using
        the recursion relations of Trapani and Navaza (2006) [2] to calculate Wigner-d functions. Transforms are
        supported for any spherical sampling pattern with equally-spaced samples of azimuth at each latitude (iso-latitude sampling).
        Additional functions are provided to evaluate spin-weighted spherical harmonics at arbitrary positions.
        
        These methods are written entirely in Python, taking advantage of numba jit compilation and numpy vector operations
        for speed.
        
        This README, a tutorial, and all function docstrings may be found on [ReadTheDocs](https://pyspherical.readthedocs.io).
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        Required:
        
        * `numpy`
        * `numba`
        * `scipy`
        
        Optional:
        
        * `sympy`
        * `pytest`
        
        ## Installation
        
        The latest release of `pyspherical` is available on PyPi:
        ```
        pip install pyspherical
        ```
        
        The bleeding-edge version may be installed directly from the repository:
        ```
        > git clone https://github.com/aelanman/pyspherical.git
        > python setup.py install
        # or
        > pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        Tests can be run using `pytest` to confirm that the installation was successful.
        
        An example script `scripts/example_1.py` demonstrates how to use some of the available evaluation and transform functions. Another script `scripts/example_2.py` plots the spherical harmonics for el < 4. Further documentation is under development.
