Line Integral Convulution for numpy Arrays
==========================================

This package aims to provide line integral convolution algorithms (lic) to Python.
There are going to be "ready to use" functions which use reasonable and well established
presets, as well as highly configurable functions for the power user. Moreover it will
provide command line tools to generate lic images without having to code a single line.
