Description: # cpm: The Chromos Project Manager  ![CI](https://github.com/jorsanpe/cpm/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
        A modern project management tool for C/C++ projects.
        
        The [docs](https://github.com/jorsanpe/cpm/wiki) are currently maintained in the repository wiki.
        
        ## Installation
        `pip3 install cpm-cli`
        
        CPM depends on [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) for the build process.
        
        ## Getting started
        ```
        cpm create DeathStartLaserBackend
        cd DeathStartLaserBackend
        cpm build
        ```
        
        After creating the project, the binary will be available in the project root directory. 
        ```
        ./DeathStartLaserBackend
        ```
        
        ### Manage dependencies
        CPM manages your project dependencies through CPM-Hub. In order to install a package, simply run:
        
        ```
        cpm install R2D2-API
        ```
        
        ### Run your tests
        ```
        cpm test
        ```
        
        Test sources reside in the `tests` directory. They are found recursively from the root directory
         using the expression `test_*.cpp`.
