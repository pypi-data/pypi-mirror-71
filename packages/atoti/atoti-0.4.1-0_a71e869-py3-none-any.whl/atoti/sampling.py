"""Sampling modes describe how data is loaded into stores.

atoti can handle very large volumes of data while still providing fast answers to queries.
However, loading a large amount of data during the modeling phase of the application is rarely
a good idea because creating stores, joins, cubes, hierarchies and measures are all operations
that take more time when there is more data.

atoti speeds up the sampling process by incoporating an automated sampling mechanism.

For instance datasets can be automatically sampled on their :func:`first lines <first_lines>` while
working on the model and then switched to the :attr:`full <FULL>` dataset when the project
is ready to be shared with other users.

By reducing the amount of data, sampling is a way to have immediate feedback for each cell run
in a notebook and keep the modeling phase as snappy as possible.

As a rule of thumb:

  * sampling is always recommended while building a project.
  * :meth:`atoti.session.Session.load_all_data` should be called as late as possible.

.. data:: FULL

    Load all the data in all the stores.
