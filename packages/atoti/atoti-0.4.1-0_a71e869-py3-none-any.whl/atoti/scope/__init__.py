        partitioning: The levels in the hierarchy at which to start the aggregation over.
        window: The custom aggregation window.
            The window defines the set of members before and after a given member (using the level comparator)
            to be considered in the computation of the cumulative aggregation.

            The window can be a:

            * ``range`` starting with a <=0 value and ending with a >=0 value.

               By default the window is ``range(-∞, 0)``, meaning that the value for a given member
               is computed using all of the members before it and none after it.

              ``None`` and ending with an offset of the form ``xxDxxWxxMxxQxxY`` or ``None``.
