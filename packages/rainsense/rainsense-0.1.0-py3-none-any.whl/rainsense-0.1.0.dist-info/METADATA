# RainSense

Python toolbox for the retrieval and processing of precipitation data from laser
disdrometers and microwave links.

RainSense is based on a collection of scripts and functions that where used in
the processing of the WUREx14 field experiment and redacted to be more reusable.

It is build around the PyHAD package and also uses ScatterPy for certain functions.

NB: The current package is still heavily work-in-progress.
