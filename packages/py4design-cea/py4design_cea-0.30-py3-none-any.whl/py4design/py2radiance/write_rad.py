def surface(name, material, points):
    """
    This function writes the surface information into Radiance readable string format.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    name :  str
        The name of the surface.
        
    material :  str
        The name of the material of the surface. The material name must be in the base.rad file.
        
    points :  pyptlist
        List of points defining the surface. Pyptlist is a list of tuples of floats. A pypt is a tuple that documents the xyz coordinates of a 
        pt e.g. (x,y,z), thus a pyptlist is a list of tuples e.g. [(x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2), ...]

    Returns
    -------
    rad surface :  str
        The surface written into radiance readable string.
