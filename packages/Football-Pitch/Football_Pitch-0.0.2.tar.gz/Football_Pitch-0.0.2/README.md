## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Python 3* were used in creating this project. 
$ pip install twine.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I have created a python package called “Football_Pitch” which I uploaded to PyPi for drawing a football pitch in my another "NFL_BigData" project

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Football_Pitch.py is the main python file which contains the "draw_pitch" function to draw a football pitch.
I used both markdown cells and # in the code to help walk through the processes of individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The package can be installed using command "pip install Football_Pitch".

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I've used the MIT licensing
