==================
Contribution guide
==================

Contributions of any size are highly welcomed and highly appreciated!
You can make a high impact on ProPlot just by using it and
reporting `issues <https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot/issues>`__.

The following sections cover some general guidelines
regarding development in ProPlot for maintainers and contributors.
Feel free to suggest improvements or changes in the workflow.

Feature requests and feedback
=============================

We are eager to hear your requests for new features, suggestions regarding the
current API, and so on. You can submit these as
`issues <https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot/issues/new>`__ on Github.
Please make sure to explain in detail how the feature should work and keep the scope as
narrow as possible. This will make it easier to implement in small pull requests.

If you are feeling inspired, feel free to add the feature yourself and
submit a pull request!


Report bugs
===========

Bugs should be reported on the Github
`issues <https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot/issues>`__ page. When reporting a
bug, please follow the template message and include copy-pasteable code that
reproduces the issue. This is critical for developers to fix the bug quickly.

If you can figure out how to fix the bug yourself, feel free to submit a pull
request.

Write tests
===========

Most modern python packages have ``test_*.py`` scripts that are run by `pytest`
via the `Travis Continuous Integration <https://travis-ci.com>`__ service
whenever commits are pushed to the repository. Currently, ProPlot only tests
the examples that appear on the website User Guide (see `.travis.yml`). While we
try to make the examples comprehensive, this approach leaves out a lot of use
cases and leaves the project more vulnerable to bugs. Adding tests is a
*critical* item on our to-do list.

If you can think of a useful test for ProPlot, feel free to submit a pull request.
Your test will be used in the future.


Write documentation
===================

Documentation can always be improved. For minor changes, you can edit docstrings and
documentation files directly in the GitHub web interface without using a local copy.

* The docstrings are written in
  `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`__
  with `numpydoc <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ style headers.
  They are embedded in the :ref:`API reference` section using a
  `fork of sphinx-automodapi <https://github.com/lukelbd/sphinx-automodapi>`__.
* Other sections are written using ``.rst`` and files and ``.py`` files
  (translated to python notebooks via
  `jupytext <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__)
  in the ``docs`` folder. The notebooks are embedded in the User Guide using
  `nbsphinx <https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.5.0/>`__.
* The `default ReST role <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-default_role>`__
  is ``py:obj``. Please include ``py:obj`` links whenever discussing particular
  functions or classes -- for example, if you are discussing the
  `~proplot.axes.Axes.format` method, please write ```~proplot.axes.Axes.format```
  rather than ``format``. ProPlot also uses
  `intersphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/intersphinx.html>`__ so you can
  link to external packages like matplotlib and cartopy.

To build the documentation locally, use the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   cd docs
   # Install dependencies to the base conda environment..
   conda env update -f environment.yml
   # ...or create a new conda environment
   # conda env create -n proplot-dev --file docs/environment.yml
   # source activate proplot-dev
   # Create HTML documentation
   make html

The built documentation should be available in ``docs/_build/html``.

Preparing pull requests
=======================

Here is a quick guide for submitting pull requests:

#. Fork the
   `proplot GitHub repository <https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot>`__.  It's
   fine to keep "proplot" as the fork repository name because it will live
   under your account.

#. Clone your fork locally using `git <https://git-scm.com/>`__, connect your
   repository to the upstream (main project), and create a branch as follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/proplot.git
      cd proplot
      git remote add upstream git@github.com:lukelbd/proplot.git
      git checkout -b your-branch-name master

   If you need some help with git, follow the
   `quick start guide <https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/QuickStart>`__.

#. Make an editable install of ProPlot by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .

   This way ``import proplot`` imports your local copy,
   rather than the stable version you last downloaded from PyPi.
   You can ``import proplot; print(proplot.__file__)`` to verify your
   local copy has been imported.

#. Install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`__ and its hook on the
   ``proplot`` repo as follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install --user pre-commit
      pre-commit install

   Afterwards ``pre-commit`` will run whenever you commit.
   `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ is a framework for managing and
   maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks to
   ensure code-style and code formatting is consistent.

#. You can now edit your local working copy as necessary. Please follow
   the `PEP8 style guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.
   and try to generally adhere to the
   `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ subset of the PEP8 style
   (we may automatically enforce the "black" style in the future).
   When committing, ``pre-commit`` will modify the files as needed,
   or will generally be clear about what you need to do to pass the pre-commit test.

   Please break your edits up into reasonably sized commits:


   .. code-block:: bash

      git commit -a -m "<commit message>"
      git push -u

   The commit messages should be short, sweet, and use the imperative mood,
   e.g. "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug".

   ..
      #. Run all the tests. Now running tests is as simple as issuing this command:
         .. code-block:: bash
            coverage run --source proplot -m py.test
         This command will run tests via the ``pytest`` tool against Python 3.7.

#. If you intend to make changes or add examples to the user guide,
   you may want to open the ``docs/*.py`` files as
   `jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.
   This can be done by
   `installing jupytext <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__,
   starting a jupyter session, and clicking on the ``.py`` files in the ``Files``
   page.

#. When you're finished, create a new changelog entry in ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
   The entry should be entered as:

   .. code-block::

      <description> (:pr:`<PR number>`) `<author name>`_

   where ``<description>`` is the description of the PR related to the change,
   ``<PR number>`` is the pull request number, and ``<author name>`` is your first
   and last name. Add yourself to list of authors at the end of ``CHANGELOG.rst``
   if not there, in alphabetical order.

   Make sure to add the changelog entry under one of the valid
   ``.. rubric:: <heading>`` headings listed at the top of ``CHANGELOG.rst``.

#. Finally, submit a pull request through the GitHub website using this data:

   .. code-block::

      head-fork: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/proplot
      compare: your-branch-name

      base-fork: lukelbd/proplot
      base: master

Note that you can create the pull request before you're finished with your
feature addition or bug fix. The PR will update as you add more commits. ProPlot
developers and contributors can then review your code and offer suggestions.


Release procedure
=================

Once version 1.0 is released, ProPlot will follow semantic versioning, with version
numbers that look like ``vX.Y.Z``. A major version (``X``) causes incompatible
API changes, a minor version (``Y``) adds functionality, and a patch (``Z``) covers
bug fixes. But these are not strict rules -- more like guidelines.
Currently, ProPlot's major version number is ``0``, reflecting the fact that
the API is new and subject to rapid changes (although we try to make sure the
changes are not without warning).

For now, `Luke Davis <https://github.com/lukelbd>`__ is the only one who can publish
releases on PyPi, but this will change in the future. Releases should
be carried out as follows:

#. Create a new branch ``release-vX.Y.Z`` with the version for the release.
   In this branch, update ``CHANGELOG.rst``, and make sure all new changes are
   reflected in the documentation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add CHANGELOG.rst
      git commit -m "Changelog updates"


#. Open a new pull request for this branch targeting ``master``.

#. After all tests pass and the pull request has been approved, merge into
   ``master``.

#. Get the latest version of the master branch:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout master
      git pull

#. Tag the current commit and push to github:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"
      git push origin master --tags

#. Build and publish release on PyPI:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Remove previous build products and build the package
      rm -r dist build *.egg-info
      python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal
      # Check the source and upload to the test repository
      twine check dist/*
      twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
      # Go to https://test.pypi.org/project/proplot/ and make sure everything looks ok
      # Then make sure the package is installable
      pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ proplot
      # Register and push to pypi
      twine upload dist/*
