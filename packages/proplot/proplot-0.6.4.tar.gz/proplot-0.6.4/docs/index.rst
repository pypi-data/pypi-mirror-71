ProPlot
=======

A lightweight `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ wrapper for making beautiful,
publication-quality graphics. This project is `published on GitHub
<https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot>`__.

Please note that due to my day job as a graduate student, `certain feature additions
<https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr>`__ may be delayed to the
summer of 2020. In the meantime, if you are interested in contributing to ProPlot,
please see the :ref:`contribution guide <Contribution guide>`. Any amount of help is
welcome!
