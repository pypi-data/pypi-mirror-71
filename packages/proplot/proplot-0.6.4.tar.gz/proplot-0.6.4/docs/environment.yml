# Hard requirements for notebook examples and documentation build
# Proplot itself just needs matplotlib
# NOTE: Basemap is broken as of matplotlib >=3.3 so for documentation
# use 3.2.1. Probably lots of basemap holdouts for next ~5 years.
# NOTE: PyQt5 is needed by pyplot, RTD server *happens* to already have it
# but creating local environment will fail.
