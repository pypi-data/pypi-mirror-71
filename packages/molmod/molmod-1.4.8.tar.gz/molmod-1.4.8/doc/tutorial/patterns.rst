Pattern-matching in molecular graphs
====================================

.. highlight:: python

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pattern matching in MolMod is a Pythonic extensible alternative to the `SMARTS
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiles_arbitrary_target_specification>`_ patterns
introduced by `Daylight Chemical Information Systesm`. It can be used to define
and detected force-field atom types in molecular graphs, to enumerate chemical
fragments in molecular graphs, or even to restore atom order consistency for a
bunch of different geometries with the same topology.

The pattern matching functionality is implemented in the modules
:mod:`molmod.graphs` and :mod:`molmod.molecular_graphs`, but it can all be
accesseded with a single import statemenent, i.e. ``from molmod import *``.


Examples
~~~~~~~~


`Basic` atom types in propane
-----------------------------

The script below detects the following atom types based on the bond graph of the
propane molecule.

- ``cach3``: Carbon in CH\ :sup:`3` group
- ``cach2``: Carbon in CH\ :sup:`2` group
- ``hach3``: Hydrogen in CH\ :sup:`3` group
- ``hach2``: Hydrogen in CH\ :sup:`2` group

An atom type in MolMod is defined as a function that takes two arguments: an
integer atom index and a MolecularGraph instance. The function returns ``True``
when the atom is of the type associated with the function and ``False``
otherwise. For example the following function represents a generic Carbon atom
type::

    def is_carbon(index, graph):
        return graph.numbers[index] == 6

One can list all carbons in a molecule by looping over all atoms and testing
each atom with the ``is_carbon`` function::

    molecule = Molecule.from_file("propane.xyz")
    molecule.set_default_graph()
    for i in xrange(molecule.graph.num_vertices):
        if is_carbon(i, graph):
            carbons.append(i)
    print carbons

One can go beyond the basics by adding extra requirements to the atom type
function, e.g. as follows::

    def is_cach3(index, graph):
        if graph.numbers[index] != 6:
            return False
        nis = graph.neighbors[index]
        if len(n) != 4:
            return False
        count_h = 0
        count_c = 0
        for ni in nis:
            if graph.numbers[ni] == 1:
                count_h += 1
            elif graph.numbers[ni] == 6:
                count_c += 1
        return (count_h==3) and (count_c==1)

This atom type definition can be used in exactly the same way as the
``is_carbon`` function. It is clear that atom types based on simple explicit
functions are error prone and time-consuming. Therefore the modules
:mod:`molmod.graphs` and :mod:`molmod.molecular_graphs` introduce ``Criteria``
classes whose instances act as atom-types. For example the following is a
completely equivalent definition of the two atom types so far::

    is_carbon = HasAtomNumber(6)
    is_cach3 = CritAnd(is_carbon, HasNeighborNumbers(1, 1, 1, 6))

These atom types act as functions that can be used in exactly the same way as
the explicit functions given above, but they are much easier to define. The
following table contains all ``Criteria`` classes that can be used to construct
atom types. Atom types constructed with ``Criteria`` classes will be referred to
as `basic` atom types. As we will see below, there is a second way to define
`advanced` atom types.

============================================= ===================================================================
Class                                         Description
============================================= ===================================================================
Anything()                                    ``True`` for any atom
CritOr(crit1, crit2, ...)                     ``True`` when one of the arguments would return True
CritAnd(crit1, crit2, ...)                    ``True`` only when all arguments would return True
CritXor(crit1, crit2, ...)                    ``True`` when an odd number of arguments would return True
CritNot(crit)                                 ``True`` only when the argument would return False
HasAtomNumber(number)                         ``True`` for an atom that has the given atom number
HasNumNeighbors(count)                        ``True`` for an atom with the given number of neighbors
HasNeighborNumbers(number1, number2, ...)     ``True`` for an atom with the same number of bonds as there are arguments and when the bonded atoms have the given atom numbers
HasNeighbors(crit1, crit2, ...)               ``True`` for an atom with the same number of bonds as there are arguments and when each bonded atoms matches one of the given criteria
============================================= ===================================================================

The script below detects all atom types in propane by looping over all atoms and
testing which atom type function returns True for each atom. If some atom has
zero or more than two matching atom types, the program raises an error.

Some `basic` atom types in dopamine
-----------------------------------

The script below detects just a few atom types in the dopamine molecule.

- ``csp3``: sp3 carbons
- ``csp2``: sp2 carbons
- ``hoh``: hydroxyl hydrogens

File: ``molmod/examples/004_patterns/b_dopamine_types.py``

.. literalinclude:: ../../molmod/examples/004_patterns/b_dopamine_types.py

This script does not complain when some atoms could not be labeled.


Some `advanced` atom types in dopamine
--------------------------------------



Detecting aromatic rings in ...
-------------------------------


Detecting benzene fragments in ...
----------------------------------


All five-membered rings in a zeolite cluster
--------------------------------------------

In this example we show how one can identify all 5T rings (i.e. with 5 silicon
and 5 oxygen atoms) in a zeolite cluster. We will use the following fragment of
the MFI framework as a cluster model:

Restoring consistent atom order
-------------------------------


Problems
~~~~~~~~


All atom types in dopamine
--------------------------

Extend the script ``b_dopamine_types.py`` such that it recognizes also the
following atom types:

- ``hcsp3``: hydrogens bonded to sp3 carbons
- ``hcsp2``: hydrogens bonded to sp2 carbons
- ``ooh``: hydroxyl oxygens
- ``nam``: amine nitrogen
- ``ham``: amine hydrogen

Now the script should assign an atom type to every atom in dopamine.
