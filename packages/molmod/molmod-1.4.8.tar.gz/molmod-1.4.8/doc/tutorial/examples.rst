MolMod by example
=================

If you are not familiar with Python yet, check out these introductory slides:

    `Python for absolute beginners <http://molmod.ugent.be/code/static/python_beginners.pdf>`_

Each chapter in this examples tutorial illustrates some related features of the
MolMod library, and always contains three sections: introduction, examples, and
problems. All examples can be found in the ``molmod/examples`` directory in the
source tree. The example scripts contain comments to explain the individual
steps. In the tutorial text, some more background is provided.
