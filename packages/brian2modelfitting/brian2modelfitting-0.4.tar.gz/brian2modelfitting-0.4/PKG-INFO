Description: brian2modelfitting
        ==================
        
        
        Model Fitting Toolbox for Brian 2 simulator, to allow the user to find the best fit of the parameters for recorded traces and spike trains.
        
        By default, we support a range of global derivative-free optimization methods, that include popular methods for model fitting, such as: Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization and Covariance Matrix Adaptation (provided by the Nevergrad) as well as Bayesian Optimization for black box functions (provided by Scikit-Optimize).
