Description: Project Description
        -------------------
        
        **this package is only meant for use within the TJREVERB pFS codebase**
        
        *use of this package in other projects is not supported and not advised*
        
        reverb-serial is a custom serial library meant for use with the Simulator
        testing suite. Instead of conducting actual serial calls to physical
        hardware, reverb-serial will save all data to a local text file which then
        can be read by the Simulator. More information on Simulator
        `here <https://github.com/TJREVERB/software-in-the-loop.git>`__.
        
        Since this package is meant to override the conventional ``pyserial``
        package, reverb-serial **MUST** be installed in a separate virtual
        environment.
