        # ngshare Course Management
        
        To manage students in your course, please don't use formgrader's web interface since it doesn't use ngshare. Instead, use the `ngshare-course-management` command that gets installed with this package. Please [read the documentation](https://ngshare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/course_management.html) for instructions on how to use this tool.
