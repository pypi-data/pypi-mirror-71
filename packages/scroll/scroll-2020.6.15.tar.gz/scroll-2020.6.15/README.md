## How it works
This tool monitors your function calls and returns while you "exercise" you program (i.e run functional tests).
It will collect this information (traces), record the order in which your functions run and generate documentations / tests using that information.


# Design concept
The final goal is to enable a developer/user browser through documentation that flows
in the order in which functions in the program run, hence the name SCROLL.
