"""This package contains copies of third party modules/packages.

This is not intended to be used directly. It is used indirectly when the
'real' package is not available. The reason for doing this is that I want
to make the CleverSheep not depend on lots of third party modules, but
some modules, such as Michele Simionato's ``decorater`` module are pretty much
essential. Replicating them here simply means I do not have to require people
to install additional modules.

The modules in here are:
