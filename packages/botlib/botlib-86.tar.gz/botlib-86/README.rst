Welcome to BOTLIB, the bot library ! see https://pypi.org/project/botlib/ , it's public domain ;]

BOTLIB can fetch RSS feeds, lets you program your own commands, can work as a UDP to IRC
relay, has user management to limit access to prefered users and can run as a service to let
it restart after reboots. BOTLIB is the result of 20 years of programming bots, was there 
in 2000, is here in 2020, has no copyright, no LICENSE and is placed in the Public Domain. 
This makes BOTLIB truely free (pastable) code you can use how you see fit, i hope you enjoy 
using and programming BOTLIB till the point you start programming your own bots yourself.

=============

you can download with pip3 and install globally:

::

 > sudo pip3 install botlib

You can also download the tarball and install from that, see https://pypi.org/project/botlib/#files

if you want to develop on the bot clone the source at bitbucket.org:

::

 > git clone https://bitbucket.org/bthate/botlib

if you want to run the bot 24/7 you can install BOTLIB as a service for
the systemd daemon. You can do this by running the following:

::

 > sudo bot cmd install

if you don't want the bot to startup at boot, remove the service file:

::

 > sudo bot cmd remove

|

C O N F I G
===========

|

to configure the bot use the ed (edit) command, with sudo:

::

 > bot cmd cfg <server> <channel> <nick>
 > bot cmd hup

U S A G E
=========

BOTLIB detects whether it is run as root or as a user. if it's root it
will use the /var/lib/botd directory and it it's user it will use ~/.bot

BOTLIB has it's own CLI, you can run it by giving the bot command on the
prompt, it will return with its own prompt:

::

 > bot
 > cmds
 cfg|cmds|ed|find|fleet|meet|ps|udp
 >

you can use bot cmd with arguments to run a command directly:

::

 > bot cmd cmds
 cfg|cmds|ed|find|fleet|meet|ps|udp

if you run with sudo, you will get additional command like install,cfg and hup:

::

 > sudo bot cmd cmds
 cfg|cmds|ed|find|fleet|hup|install|meet|ps|remove|udp


R S S

|

to add an url use the rss command with an url:

::

 > bot cmd rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
 ok 1

run the rss command to see what urls are registered:

::

 > bot cmd rss
 0 https://news.ycombinator.com/rss

the fetch command can be used to poll the added feeds:

::

 > bot cmd fetch
 fetched 0

U D P
=====

|

using udp to relay text into a channel, use the okudp program to send text via the bot 
to the channel on the irc server:

::

 > tail -f /var/log/syslog | bot cmd udp

to send the tail output to the IRC channel, send a udp packet to the bot:

::

 import socket

 def toudp(host=localhost, port=5500, txt=""):
     sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
     sock.sendto(bytes(txt.strip(), "utf-8"), host, port)
