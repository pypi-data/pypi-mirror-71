        # Circlecore
        
        Circlecore is a cheat detection library for osu!.
        
        Circlecore currently supports detection of the following cheats:
        
        * Replay Stealing
        * Relax
        * Aim Correction
        * Timewarp
        
        Designed for use in [Circleguard](https://github.com/circleguard/circleguard), circlecore is easily integratable into any existing python project and we have worked hard to ensure it is easy to use.
        
        Circleguard is developed and maintained by:
        
        * [tybug](https://github.com/tybug)
        * [samuelhklumpers](https://github.com/samuelhklumpers)
        * [InvisibleSymbol](https://github.com/InvisibleSymbol)
        
        ## Installation
        
        Circlecore can be installed from pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install circleguard
        ```
        
        This documentation refers to the project as `circlecore` to differentiate it from our organization [Circleguard](https://github.com/circleguard) and the gui application [Circleguard](https://github.com/circleguard/circleguard). However, `circlecore` is installed from pypi with the name `circleguard`, and is imported as such in python (`import circleguard`).

        cg = Circleguard("key")
        r1 = ReplayMap(221777, 2757689)
        r2 = ReplayMap(221777, 4196808)
        for r in cg.steal_check([r1, r2]): # r is a StealResult
            print(f"{r.replay1.username} +{r.replay1.mods} vs {r.replay2.username} "
                  f"+{r.replay2.mods} on {r.replay1.map_id}. {r.similarity} sim")
        ```
        
        ```python
        from circleguard import *
        
        cg = Circleguard("key")
        m = Map(221777, span="1-2")
        cg.load_info(m)
        for r in m:
            print(f"User {r.username} +{r.mods} on map {r.map_id}")
