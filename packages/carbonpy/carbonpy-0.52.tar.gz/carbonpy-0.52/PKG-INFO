Description: # Carbonpy
        A module which names straight/branched chain organic compounds, suggests conversions from one type to another, etc.
        
        ## Usage-
        
        ### Naming compounds-
        Instantiate the class `Namer()` , which takes a string which contains the hydrocarbon (condensed form) and then call it with a method named `analyser()` to get the IUPAC name of the compound.
        
        Example:
        ```
        a = Namer('CH~CH')
        a.analyser()
        >>> Ethyne
        ```
        
        Due to limitations in expressing a hydrocarbon easily, we have selected this path  
        Single bond:- -  
        Double bond:- =  
        Triple bond:- ~  
        Branches:- -([compound] (more branches...))([another branch from same carbon])- and so on  
        (Branches support coming soon)
        
        You can also get the molecular formula of the compound:
        ```
        compound = Namer('CH~C-C~C-CH=C=C=CH2')
        compound.molecular_formula()
        >>> Câ‚ˆHâ‚„
        ```
        Example- 2-Methylpropane would be expressed as (once branches are supported):
        ```
        a = Namer('CH3-CH(CH3)-CH3').analyser()
        >>> 2-Methylpropane
        ```
        
        Will support naming with functional groups in the future.
