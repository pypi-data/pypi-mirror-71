#### ***Please note:*** This is a prototype in early development

## Kammanta

Kammanta is a **productivity** and **life organizing** application inspired by the GTD© methodology,
and with two features that set it apart:
* Data is **stored as text files and directories** (the actual names of files and dirs are used)
* The application is ***free software*** (free as in freedom) which means that the source code is
open, and you can copy and create your own application if you want

### Installation
