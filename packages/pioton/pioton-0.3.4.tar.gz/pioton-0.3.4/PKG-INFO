Description: 
        Píotón - Write Python code in Irish in IPython
        
        ---
        
        Installation:
        
        pip: pip install pioton 
        
        github: clone the repo, move the contents of the pioton/ folder somewhere accessible by your PythonPATH
        
        ---
        
        USAGE Transpiled:
        
        write your píotón code in one or more scripts with a '.pag' (Python as Gaeilge) extension, and run 
        
        tiomsaitheoir file.pag [file2.pag [...]]
        
        which will transpile the píotón scripts into pure Python '.py' files. Running 
        
        tiomsaitheoir -h
        
        will provide further details and examples, and running 
        
        tiomsaitheoir -s
        
        will show an overview of the syntax for píotón code 
        
        USAGE IPython:
        
        simply import píotón in any IPython environment (including Jupyter Notebooks) and start writing your code as Gaeilge.
        Call `pioton.show_syntax()` to print a full description of the new irish syntax.
        
        THIS IS FOR FUN - DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT
        
        I can't stress that enough, I really didn't make sure it's robust at all, it's against Python standards, any code written in it will be completely unmaintainable, etc.
