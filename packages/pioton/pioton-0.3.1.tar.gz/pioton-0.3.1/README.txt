# Píotón - Write Python code in Irish in IPython
---
### Installation:

pip: pip install pioton 

github: clone the repo, move the contents of the pioton/ folder somewhere accessible by your PythonPATH

---
#### USAGE Transpiled:
write your píotón code in one or more scripts with a '.pag' (Python as Gaeilge) extension, and run 

tiomsaitheoir file.pag [file2.pag [...]]

which will transpile the píotón scripts into pure Python '.py' files. Running 

tiomsaitheoir -h

will provide further details and examples, and running 

tiomsaitheoir -s

will show an overview of the syntax for píotón code 

#### USAGE IPython:
simply import píotón in any IPython environment (including Jupyter Notebooks) and start writing your code as Gaeilge.
Call `pioton.show_syntax()` to print a full description of the new irish syntax.

#### THIS IS FOR FUN - DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT
I can't stress that enough, I really didn't make sure it's robust at all, it's against Python standards, any code written in it will be completely unmaintainable, etc.
