A database interface that acts like a python dictionary

Install
=======

pip install dictabase


Create a new table
------------------

::

    # Create a table representing users
    from dictabase import BaseTable, RegisterDBURI

    RegisterDBURI() # pass nothing to default to sqlite

    class UserClass(BaseTable):
        pass

    newUser = New(UserClass, name='Grant', age=31)
    newUser = New(UserClass, name='Bob', age=99)
    # there is now a sqlite database containing the 2 users. Yup, thats it!

Look up items in the database
-----------------------------

::

    from dictabase import FindOne, FindAll

    allUsers = FindAll(UserClass)
    # allUsers is an iterable of all the UserClass objects that exists in the database
    print('allUsers=', list(allUsers))
    >> allUsers= [<UserClass: name='Grant', age=31>, <UserClass: name='Bob', age=99>]

    user = FindOne(UserClass, name='Grant')
    print('user=', user)
    >>user= <UserClass: name='Grant', age=31>

    user = FindOne(UserClass, name='NotARealName')
    print('user=', user)
    >>user= None

Read/Write to the database
--------------------------

::

    # find an object that was previously put in the database
    user = FindOne(UserClass, name='Grant')

    # increment the age of the user by 1
    user['age'] += 1
    # Thats it! the database has now been updated with the new age

Drop a table
------------

::

    from dictabase import Drop
    Drop(UserClass, confirm=True)
    # the table has been removed from the database

Delete a specific row in a table
--------------------------------

::

    from dictabase import Delete
    # find an object that was previously put in the database
    user = FindOne(UserClass, name='Grant')
    Delete(user)
    # the user has been removed from the database
