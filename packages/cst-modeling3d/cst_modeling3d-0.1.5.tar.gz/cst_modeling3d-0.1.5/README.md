# cst_modeling

Surface and curve modeling via CST (class shape transformation) method

The curves, e.g., foil's upper and lower surface, are constructed via CST method.

The multi-section surface is interpolated from several control sections.

## Installation

``` bash
pip install cst-modeling3d
```

## Using the module

Details for usage can be found in code comments.

### Airfoil

1. build an airfoil

    CST coefficients of upper and lower surface can have different sizes.

    ``` python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import cst_foil
    >>> nn = 1001
    >>> cst_u = [ 1.0,  1.0,  1.0]
    >>> cst_l = [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0]
    >>> x, yu, yl, t0, R0 = cst_foil(nn, cst_u, cst_l)
    ```

2. find CST coefficients of an airfoil

    cst_u, cst_l are of the same size

    ``` python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import cst_foil_fit
    >>> cst_u, cst_l = cst_foil_fit(x, yu, x, yl, n_order=7)
    ```

3. get geometry information of an airfoil

    thickness/camber distribution, curvature of upper/lower surface

    ```python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import foil_tcc
    >>> thickness, curv_u, curv_l, camber = foil_tcc(x, yu, yl)
    ```

4. check whether the airfoil is reasonable or not

    ```python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import check_valid
    >>> rule_invalid = check_valid(x, yu, yl, RLE)
    ```

5. modify airfoil by adding a bump

    ```python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import foil_bump_modify
    >>> yu_new, yl_new = foil_bump_modify(x, yu, yl, xc, h, s, side)
    ```

6. modify curve by adding an incremental curve

    ```python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import foil_increment
    >>> yu_new, yl_new = foil_increment(x, yu, yl, cst_u, cst_l)
    ```

7. output airfoil

    ```python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import output_foil
    >>> output_foil(x, yu, yl, fname='airfoil.dat', ID=0, info=False)
    ```

8. 2D curve's translation, scale, and rotation in z-axis

    ```python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import transform
    >>> xu_, xl_, yu_, yl_ = transform(x, x, yu, yl, scale=1.0)
    ```

9. rotate the 3D curve according to origin

    ```python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import rotate
    >>> x_, y_, z_ = rotate(x, y, z, angle=0.0, axis='X')
    ```

10. linearly stretch a curve when certain point is fixed

    ```python
    >>> from cst_modeling.foil import stretch_fixed_point
    >>> x_, y_ = stretch_fixed_point(x, y, dx=0.0, dy=0.0)
    ```

### Section

Section is a class for control sections.

The section stores unit 2D curves of upper and lower surface (xx, yu, yl), as well as CST coefficients (cst_u, cst_l).

The 3D curve (x, y, z) is then generated from the 2D curves. It starts from the lower surface trailing edge and ends at the upper surface trailing edge.

The 3D curve is still a plane curve, the leading edge location (xLE, yLE, zLE), chord length, twist angle (deg), maximum relative thickness, relative tail thickness are defined by user.

### Multi-section surface

Surface is a class for multi-section surface.

```python
>>> from cst_modeling.surface import Surface
>>> wing = Surface(n_sec=3, name='Wing', nn=101, ns=51)
>>> wing.read_setting('Wing.txt', tail=0.1)
```

1. construct geometry

    showfoil:   if True, output name-foil.dat of airfoils
    split:      if True, generate surfaces as upper and lower separately

    ```python
    >>> wing.geo(split=True, showfoil=True)
    ```

2. output the surface in tecplot format

    one_piece:  if True, combine the span-wise sections into one piece

    ```python
    >>> wing.output_tecplot(fname='Wing.dat', one_piece=False)
    ```

3. output the surface in plot3d format

    ```python
    >>> wing.output_plot3d(fname='Wing.grd')
    ```

4. plot surface by matplotlib

    ```python
    >>> wing.plot(fig_id=1, type='wireframe')
    ```

5. flipping the surface (turing 90 degrees or mirror)

    Note: This should be the last action before output

    ```python
    >>> wing.flip(axis='+X +Z')
    ```

6. add sections to the surface

    the new sections are interpolated from current ones

    Note: must run before geo() and flip()

    ```python
    >>> wing.add_sec(location=[8, 12.0], axis='Z')
    ```

7. bend surfaces by angle and leader curve

    This is for constructing surfaces with curved leading edge lines,
    e.g., strut of the SBW aircraft, wing-let.

    ```python
    >>> wing.bend(******)
    ```

8. smooth the surface between given sections

    ```python
    >>> wing.smooth(isec0, isec1)
    ```
