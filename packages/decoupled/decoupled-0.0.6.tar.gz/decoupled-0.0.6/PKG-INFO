Description: # decoupled
        
        ## Motivation
        Imagine...
        * You're developing a python extension OR
        * You're writing some C or C++ code, but decided to add some python bindings
        because you're more familiar with python unit testing libraries
        
        Now this C/C++ code can fail in ways which Python code cannot.
        It can cause a segfault and take your whole Python process down.
        That means, that your testing library doesn't get to display it's results - 
        you don't get told which tests fail.
        
        ## The solution
        decoupled runs your code in a separate process. If it crashes, this doesn't
        take down the parent process. Instead, a ChildCrashedError is raised
        in your parent process.
