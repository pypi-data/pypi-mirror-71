# Check Commander

Check Commander is an efficient [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) interface for the monitoring software [Checkmk](https://checkmk.com/).

Most day-to-day activities like time limited acknowledgement, downtime, reinventorize, look up server in a wiki, copy alert text for a ticket system and SSH in to servers can be done with a few keypresses. See screenshots to understand what it's about.

## Screenshots

SSH to selected host (which opens a new terminal, in this case a new split in tilix):

Acknowledge an alert and display help:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* An up to date Checkmk instance.
* Linux, MacOS (not tested on other platforms yet)
* Python 3.6 or later

### Installation

From PIP:

```bash
pip3 install checkmk-commander
```

Run command: ```chkcom```. It usually ends up in ~/.local/bin on linux (installed with --user), /Users/<user>/Library/Python/3.8/bin on MacOS.

### Configuration

You need a "machine" account for your Checkmk instance. A normal user won't work. See [Checkmk user config](https://checkmk.com/cms_wato_user.html#user_config).

You will be asked for configuration details on first run, and a config will be created at``` ~/.config/check-commander.ini```

Example check commander config:

    host = http://omd.lxd/test/
    username = automation
    secret = long-random-string

How an ssh connection is opened can be changed. Suggested alternatives (put one in config file):

    terminal_command = x-terminal-emulator -e ssh HOSTNAME
    terminal_command = tmux split-window -v -c "$PWD" ssh HOSTNAME
    terminal_command = tmux new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}" ssh HOSTNAME

These should open default terminal, split your current tmux tab and open new tmux tab respectively.

How a wiki is opened can be changed. Suggested alternative:

    url_with_hostname = https://wiki.example.com/?search=HOSTNAME

Refresh delay in seconds can be set thus:

    delay = 5

### Hot-keys

Press ? in app to get an overview.

## Support

Open a gitlab issue if you hit a bug or need help.

## Implementation details

Uses CheckMK's web API.

Additional functionality like copy to clipboard or open browser requires python modules cliboard and webbrowser. You will be notified to install them.

## Known bugs

* Calling a reschedule may give the error "ERROR - you did an active check on this service - please disable active checks". Not sure why this happens.
* If a non-OMD site is connected to your "distributed monitoring", calling WATO commands on it will return 200 and an error. The WATO command will not be run.

## Development

Tests can be run with ```tox```. Static tests have been done with prospector.
