class Menu(BaseMenu):
    """Implementation of a menu who has got, by definition, a content to display
    (i.e. what the user will see by accessing it), a limit of buttons displayed
    per row and a custom text displayed for going back to the parent menu, if
    any.

    Parameters:
        name (str): The name you give to the menu, which will be used as
            the text of callback button, if needed. See `BaseMenu` for more
            information.
        menu_id (str): The unique identifier given to the menu, which will
            refer unequivocally to this entity. The hash for this class is
            generated relying on the content of this field. Avoid using ``0``
            as it is used for buttons whose purpose is only related to
            design (i.e. they do not point to any menu). See `BaseMenu`
            for more information.
        content (Types.Content): What will be displayed whenever a user
            accesses this menu. Both text and media can be provided. A
            function can be provided as well and must follow the following
            arguments pattern::

                func(handler, client, context, parameters)

        back_button_text (Optional[str]): The text which will be displayed
            inside the button that lets the user go back to the parent
            menu. Defaults to "ðŸ”™".
        default (Optional[bool]): If this menu shall be displayed if no
            other top-level menu has been matched. It works only if this
            menu is a top-level one.
        limit (Optional[int]): The limit of buttons per row. Defaults to 2.
        message_filter (Optional[Filter]): A filter for telling Pyrogram
            when a message should be associated to this menu. It works only
            for top-level menus (see `Handler.setup`). Defaults to ``None``,
            which automatically makes this menu reachable when the user texts
            a message that follows this pattern::

                /[MENU_ID]

        preliminary (Types.Preliminary): A function which is executed each time
            before doing anything else in `on_callback` and `on_message`.
            You can provide a list of such functions as well, which will be
            executed following the same order as the one of the list.
            Defaults to ``None``, which means that no function is going to
            be executed.

    Note:
        This implementation is compatible with a non-parameterized handler.
