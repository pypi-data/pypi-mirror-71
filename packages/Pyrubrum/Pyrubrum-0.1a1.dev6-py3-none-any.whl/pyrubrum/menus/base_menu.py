class BaseMenu(ABC):
    """Basic represention of a menu, which is an entity that has got by definition
    at least a name and a unique identifier.

    The purpose of this class is to give a general interface for a menu, as it
    doesn't implement anything except for the generation of both buttons and
    hashes.

    A sample implementation of this interface is `Menu`.

    Parameters:
        name (str): The name you give to the menu, which will be used as the
            text of callback button, if needed.
        menu_id (str): The unique identifier given to the menu, which will
            refer unequivocally to this entity. The hash for this class is
            generated relying on the content of this field. Avoid using ``0``
            as it is used for buttons whose purpose is only related to design
            (i.e. they do not point to any menu).

    Note:
        In order to create a subclass or to access this interface, you will
        need to implement all the defined abstract methods, which are
        `get_content`, `keyboard`, `on_callback`, `on_message`. Otherwise, you
        will get an error.

    Warning:
        Avoid using the same identifier for other entities, as it will result
        in ambiguity.
