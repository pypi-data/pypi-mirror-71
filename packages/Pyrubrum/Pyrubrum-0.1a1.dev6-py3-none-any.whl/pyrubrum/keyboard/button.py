class Button:
    """Representation of a button which belongs to an inline keyboard and has got,
    by definition, a unique identifier, which actually represents the menu this
    object is referring to, an `Element` identifier (i.e. the identifier of the
    object that is carried by the button and is then passed to the menu it is
    referring to, if any), a name, which is displayed inside the text field of
    the inline button, and a dictionary of parameters.

    The dictionary that is passed as argument for representing parameters is
    always deep copied, if not ``None``.

    Parameters:
        name (str): The name which is displayed inside the text field of
            the inline button this object will be converted to.
        button_id (str): The unique identifier of the button, which is the
            same as the one of the menu the button is referring to.
        parameters (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]): The parameters that will be
            passed to the menu this button is referring to. Defaults to
            ``None`` (i.e. the handler does not support parameterization).
        element_id (Optional[str]): The unique identifier of the `Element`
            the button is carrying, if any. Defaults to an empty string.
        same_menu (Optional[bool]): If the button is referring to the same
            menu by which it was initialized. Defaults to ``False``.
        **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments which can be used as a way to
            define a new parameter (``key=value``) that will be added to
            the dictionary of parameters.

    Warning:
        There is a special group of names which are not available for being
        used as keys for parameters. These are ``button_id``,
        ``callback_query_id`` and ``same_menu``. If provided, they will be
        overwritten. As a result of being passed as parameter inside a
        callback query (see `ParameterizedBaseHandler.process_keyboard`),
        ``element_id`` does not maintain its type and will always be
        initialized as a string. Keys starting with ``page_`` shall be
        avoided accordingly to `PageMenu.keyboard`.
