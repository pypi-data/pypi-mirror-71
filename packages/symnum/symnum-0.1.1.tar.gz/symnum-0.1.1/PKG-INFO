Description: SymNum is a Python package that acts a bridge between NumPy and SymPy,providing a NumPy-like interface that can be used to symbolically define functions which take arrays as arguments and return arrays or scalars as values. A series of Autograd style functional differential operators are also provided to construct derivatives of symbolic functions, with the option to generate NumPy code to numerically evaluate these derivative functions.
