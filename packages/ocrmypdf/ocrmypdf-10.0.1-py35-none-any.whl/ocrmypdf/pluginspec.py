    conversion. By default with we pick PDF/A-2b, but this works for 1 or 3.

    compression can be 'jpeg', 'lossless', or an empty string. In 'jpeg',
    Ghostscript is instructed to convert color and grayscale images to DCT
    (JPEG encoding). In 'lossless' Ghostscript is told to convert images to
    Flate (lossless/PNG). If the parameter is omitted Ghostscript is left to
    make its own decisions about how to encode images; it appears to use a
    heuristic to decide how to encode images. As of Ghostscript 9.25, we
    support passthrough JPEG which allows Ghostscript to avoid transcoding
    images entirely. (The feature was added in 9.23 but broken, and the 9.24
    release of Ghostscript had regressions, so we don't support it until 9.25.)
