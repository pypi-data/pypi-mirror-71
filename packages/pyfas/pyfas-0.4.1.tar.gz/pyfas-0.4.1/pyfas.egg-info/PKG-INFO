        # Pyfas
        
        Pyfas is a python toolbox for flow assurance engineers.
        
        ### Wrappers
        At this moment in time the toolbox contains wrappers for:
        
        * OLGA 
        * Unisim Design
        * GAP 
        * Pipesim (via OpenLink, for all the versions <= 2012.4)
        
        **Olga** is the standard de facto for the dynamic simulations of multiphase
        systems (single pipelines or complex network) in the oil and gas indistry. The
        simulator has text input and output files; with pyfas you can expose Olga
        results to python (both trends and profiles) or dump all the results to excel/csv
        for your post-precessing.
        
        **UnisimDesign** is mainly a process simulator but can be used also to simulate
        pipelines or networks in particular providing some external components.
        Differently from Olga Unisim (unfortunately) does not use text input or
        output files, the only way to communicate with the software is via a COM interface
        using pywin32.  Pyfas does not pretend to exposes all the possible
        functionalities of Unisim, only a very limited subset is available at the
        moment.
        
        **PipeSim** is a steady state simulator for both single branches or networks
        
        ### Utilities
        
        * Tab files processing
        * Surge volume calculation
        * PIRead functionality
        
        **Tab files** are look-up tables with specific thermodynamic properties at
        given pressure and temperature intervals used for flash calculations by dynamic
        simulators. These files are generated by thermodynamic simulators (like
        PTVTsim) and it is good practice to have a look on this information *before*
        a dynamic simulation. With pyfas it is possible to generate 3d plots of all the
        properties and examine more in detail critical ones. 
        
        The **surge volume calculation** utility returns the surge volume given a drain
        rate and a liquid flowrate time series. Not more than a simple discrete
        integration.
        
        With **PIRead** it is possible to retrieve PI values from a PI server.
        
        A live demo should be available here below (no installation required)
