# Development & Documentation
## pyords ```Bundle```s

```Bundle```s are self-contained problem definitions implemented as modular instances. That's wanna-be fancy for packaged units of code that are very plug-in and play. Contributing to ```Bundle``` development:

1. Design the problem as a ```Case``` where the ```Case``` can be tested against various ```Bundle```s that solve the problem defined in the ```Case```. For the purposes of this ```README``` we'll use ```VrpVehicleCase```. ```Case```s must help define what is required of a feature implementation (or the improvement of one). For our ```VrpVehicleCase``` we'll assume a set of data and configurations for basic vrp model requirements and a desired output of optimized vehicles to append to our data.

2. Build a ```Bundle```. The bundle should be specific to the ```Case```(s) it solves. Maybe you see where I'm going with this. There are **two** core components of this library:
    - ```Bundle```s
    - ```Case```s

3. Test the ``Case`` against its ```Bundle```. 

4. Submit implementation with documentation supporting the reason for its development.

### ```VrpVehicleCase```
- defines allowable data for one or many vehicles outputs via vrp optimization
- defines input expectations & tests
- defines ```Case``` expectations & tests
- defines output expectations & tests
- related:
  - GeoBundle
  - OrBundle

### ```GeoBundle```
- processed zipcode outputs, lat and lon outputs, haversine distance outputs, and lat and lon cluster outputs
- integrations:
  - lats lons: [pgeocode](https://github.com/symerio/pgeocode)
  - distances: [haversine](https://github.com/mapado/haversine)
- related:
  - ZipcodeCleanCase
  - LatLonCase
  - LatLonDistanceCase
  - LatLonClusterCase

### ```OrBundle```
- operations research optimizations: vrp, network optimization, scheduling.
- opportunity analysis, health checks.
- implementations:
  - Vrp optimization via Google OrTools
  - Schedule optimization via Genetic Algorithm
- integrations: 
  - vrp: [google ortools](https://github.com/google/or-tools)

## using pyords ```Bundle```s for vehicle optimization

```python
import pyords as pyr


df = pd.read_csv('my_shipment_data.csv')

# TODO: implement this bundle (currently not refactored)
geobndl = pyr.GeoBundle(zipcodes=df.zipcodes)
lats, lons = geo_bndl.pgeo('US')
matrix = geobndl.haversine_all_from(origin=origin, 'mi')
clusters = geobndl.cluster(by='geocodes')

vrpbndl = pyr.VrpBundle(matrix=matrix, demand=df.pallets)
df = vrpbndl.run().cast_solution_to_df(clustered_df)
```

## Testing pyords ```Bundle```s :white_check_mark:

```python
import pyords as pyr

class VrpVehicleCase:
    inputs = {
        'matrix': [[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0]],
        'demand': [0, 3, 4],
        'max_vehicle_capacity': 5,
        'partitions': [1, 1, 1],
        'max_search_seconds': 30
    }

    outputs = {
        'vehicle_id': [1, 2]
    }

    implementation = None # TODO: pyr.ortools.vrp

    def run(self):
        bndl = pyr.VrpBundle(case=self)
        
        assert bndl.test()

        return self

if __name__ == '__main__':
    VrpVehicleCase.run()
```
