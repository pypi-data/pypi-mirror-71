Welcome to Scikit-downscale's documentation!
===============================

Scikit-downscale is a toolkit for statistical downscaling usising Xarray_.
It is meant to support the development of new and existing downscaling
methods in a common framework. It implements a fit/predict API that
accepts Xarray objects, similiar to Python's Scikit-Learn_, for building
a wide range of statitical downscaling models.

Under Active Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scikit-downscale is under active development. We are looking for additional
contributors to help fill out the list of downscaling methods supported here.
We are also looking to find collaborators interested in using deep learning
to build global downscaling tools. Get in touch with us on our
`GitHub page <https://github.com/jhamman/scikit-downscale>`_.
