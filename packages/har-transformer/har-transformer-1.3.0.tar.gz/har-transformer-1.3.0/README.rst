Transformer
***********

A **command-line tool** and **Python library** to convert web browser sessions
(`HAR`_ files) into Locust_ load test scenarios ("locustfiles").

.. _HAR: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har
.. _Locust: https://locust.io/

Use it to **replay HAR files** (storing recordings of interactions with your
website) **in load tests** with Locust_.

.. contents::
   :local:

Installation
============

Install from PyPI::

   pip install har-transformer

Note that the new major version of Locust (1.0 and up) is not yet supported.
Please make sure you have a compatible Locust to run your locustfiles::

   pip install locustio==0.14.6

We hope to lift this restriction very soon!

Usage
=====

Example HAR files are included in the ``examples/`` directory, try them
out.

Command-line
------------

.. code:: bash

   transformer my_har_files_directory/ >locustfile.py

Library
-------

.. code:: python

   import transformer

   with open("locustfile.py", "w") as f:
       transformer.dump(f, ["my_har_files_directory/"])

Documentation
=============

Take a look at our documentation_ for more details, including how to **generate
HAR files**, **customize your scenarios**, use or write **plugins**, etc.
