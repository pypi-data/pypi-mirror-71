Scora CLI
=============================

This CLI is coupled with the Idea of the Scora Platform and Scora Blocks to:

* Configure Cloud Stacks removing the complexity of writing templates;
* Helping on CI/CD projects with the Airflow on the architecture defined by Scora Blocks;
* Helping configuring repositories for fullstack apps that use Cognito, CloudFront, S3 and Lambda;
