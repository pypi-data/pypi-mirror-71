This is is the **downsampling** pipeline from the `Sequana <https://sequana.readthedocs.org>`_ project

:Overview: downsample NGS data sets
:Input: a set of FastQ or FASTA files 
:Output: a set of downsampled files
:Status: mature

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must install Sequana first::

    pip install sequana

Then, just install this package::

    pip install sequana_downsampling


Usage
~~~~~

::

    sequana_pipelines_downsampling --help
    sequana_pipelines_downsampling --input-directory DATAPATHH
    sequana_downsampling --downsampling-method random --downsampling-max-entries 100


This creates a directory with the pipeline and configuration file. You will then need 
to execute the pipeline::

    cd downsampling
    sh downsampling.sh  # for a local run

This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can 
retrieve the pipeline itself and its configuration files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::

    snakemake -s downsampling.rules -c config.yaml --cores 4 --stats stats.txt

Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html>`_ interface.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pipelines requires the following executable(s):

- sequana
- pigz

Details
~~~~~~~~~

This pipeline runs **downsampling** in parallel on the input fastq or fasta files (paired or not). 


Rules and configuration details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the `latest documented configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/sequana_downsampling/master/sequana_pipelines/downsampling/config.yaml>`_
to be used with the pipeline. Each rule used in the pipeline may have a section in the configuration file.
