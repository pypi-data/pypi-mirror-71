        ======================
        
        Spor-based filter for Cosmic Ray mutation testing.
        
        The filter scans a Cosmic Ray session, looking for spor anchors attached to files in the session. If it finds an anchor
        with the metadata `{mutate: False}`, then that mutation is marked as "skipped".
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Assume you've got a directory structure like this::
        
          project_root/
              .spor/
                 ...anchors...
              cr-session.sqlite
              src/
                 ...project source...
        
        If you run this command::
        
          cosmic-ray-spor-filter cr-session.sqlite
        
        will look at each job scheduled in `cr-session.sqlite`. If the file referenced in job has an anchor in the `.spor`
        directory *and* if that anchor has `{mutate: False}` in its metadata, then that job will be skipped.
