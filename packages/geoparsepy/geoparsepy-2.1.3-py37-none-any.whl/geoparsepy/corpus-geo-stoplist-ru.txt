# russian 'ru'
# corpus of stoplist words applied to location entities prior to matching to avoid poor OSM names that are not informative enough to be useful
# location phrases from OSM that only contain tokens in the stoplist are deleted (so cannot cause a match)
# note: save as UTF8 encoded file
# notw: WORDNet is checked for any non-noun word so words here should only need to be nouns
