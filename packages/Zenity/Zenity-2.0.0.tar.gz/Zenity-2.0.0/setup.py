__doc__="""zenity - display dialogs with python
DESCRIPTION
zenity  is a Python library that will display GTK+ dialogs using zanity 
tool, and return (eitherin the return code, or on standard output) the 
users input. This allows you to present information, and ask for infor
mation from the user.

For example, zenity.show(zenity.question) will return either 0, 1 or 5,  depending
on  whether  the  user  pressed OK, Cancel or timeout has been reached.
zenity.show(zenity.entry) will output on standard output what the user typed  into
the text entry field.
Comprehensive documentation is coming soon.

ENVIRONMENT
Normally, zenity detects the window from which it was launched
and keeps itself above that window.  This behavior can be  disabled  by
unsetting the WINDOWID environment variable.
