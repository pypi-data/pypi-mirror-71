scared is a side-channel analysis framework.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need **Python 3.6+** to use and install scared. You can use pip (or any pip based tool like pipenv) or conda to install it.

### Installation

To install scared, you can use pip (or pipenv, or any other pip based-tool) or conda:

```bash
$ pip install scared
# or with Conda
$ conda install -c eshard scared
```

### Make a first cool thing

Start using scared by doing a cool thing:

```python
# First import the lib
import scared

# Define a selection function
@scared.attack_selection_function
def first_add_key(plaintext, guesses):
    res = np.empty((plaintext.shape[0], len(guesses), plaintext.shape[1]), dtype='uint8')
    for i, guess in enumerate(guesses):
        res[:, i, :] = np.bitwise_xor(plaintext, guess)
    return res

# Create an analysis CPA
a = scared.CPAAttack(
        selection_function=first_add_key,
        model=scared.HammingWeight(),
        discriminant=scared.maxabs)

# Load some traces, for example a dpa v2 subset
ths = scared.traces.read_ths_from_ets('dpa_v2.ets')

# Create a container for your ths
container = scared.Container(ths)

# Run!
a.run(container)
```
