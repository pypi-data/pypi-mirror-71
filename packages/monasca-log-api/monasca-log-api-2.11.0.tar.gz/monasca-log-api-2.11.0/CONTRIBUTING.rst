If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps documented at:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#getting-started

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Storyboard (using tag **bug**), not GitHub:
