Description: Wagtail React StreamField
        =========================

           :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wagtail-react-streamfield
        
        Drop-in replacement for the StreamField in `Wagtail <https://wagtail.io/>`_.
        
        This work was funded thanks to
        `a Kickstarter campaign <https://kickstarter.com/projects/noripyt/wagtails-first-hatch>`_!
        
        It relies on `react-streamfield <https://github.com/noripyt/react-streamfield>`_,
        a React package created for the occasion.
        
        **This work is currently in beta phase and will in the end be merged in Wagtail.**
        You should be careful and manually check that it works for your own StreamField
        and report any bug you find.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Wagtail 2.6 or above.
        
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        It’s really easy to setup, like most NoriPyt packages:
        
        - ``pip install wagtail-react-streamfield``
        - Add ``'wagtail_react_streamfield',`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
          **before** ``'wagtail.admin'``, ``'wagtail.images'``, ``'wagtail.docs'``
          & ``'wagtail.snippets'``
        
        That’s it!
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        wagtail-react-streamfield has the same class API as the regular StreamField.
        What changes:
        
        ``Meta`` attributes (or passed to __init__)
        ...........................................
        
        ``closed``
          Set to ``True`` to close all blocks of this type when loading the page.
          Defaults to ``False``.
