# Multiconfparse

Multiconfparse is a Python3 library for specifying and reading configuration
data from multiple sources, including the command line, environment variables
and various config file formats. The API is very similar to the [Argparse
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)'s.

Documentation for the library is at [multiconfparse.readthedocs.io](https://multiconfparse.readthedocs.io).
