Description: 
        ``expat-fatcat`` helps US taxpayers living abroad file their tax returns to
        comply with the IRS and
        FATCA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act).
        A significant pain point in this process is that all foreign payments (income
        or deductions) must be converted to USD with a valid rate on the date of
        payment. This can readily add up to 40+ historical FX-rates to look up and
        then paste into the usual Excel accounting madness. Some people may consider a
        little copy-paste drudge work once a year a minor annoyance, but what are
        programming and APIs for if not injecting some fun into an otherwise dreary
        task?
        
        The core functionality of ``expat-fatcat`` is an historical FX-rate lookup with
        smoothing in case of a missing exhange rate. Currently, we use the FX-service
        Quandl (https://www.quandl.com/) in ``QuandlRateCoverterToUSD``, which is a
        sub-class of ``AbsRateConverterTo``. Other FX-rate services could be readily
        integrated as required.
