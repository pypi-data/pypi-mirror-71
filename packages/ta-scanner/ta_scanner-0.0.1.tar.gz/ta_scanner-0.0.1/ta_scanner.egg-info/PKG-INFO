Description: # Technical Analaysis Scanner
        
        ## Goals
        
        This software attempts to provide a framework that does a combination of
        (1) scanning and, (2) backtesting to ask and answer such questions as,
        
        - which instruments have responded well to the 4 hr MACD(26, 9, 12) in the
        last quarter?
        
        - which stocks are getting close to their 20/50 Moving Average Crossover, and
        of those stocks, which have responded more than +/- 2.5% in the past?
        
        - which instruments in the last 2 weeks after trended out of their opening
        ranges? What is the 1 and 2 std dev band for each isntrument at 30 minute
        intervals?
        
        ### Digging a little deeper
        
        Technical analysis sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't. The goal of this
        codebase is to provide means/methods for measuring a universe of instruments
        and determine which ones are behaving in line with various TA patterns
        
        It's intended to work differently than a traditional backtester (eg, a
        Quantopian and QuantConnect). From what I undestand about backtesting, the
        goal is to provide predetermined entry and exit rules, and measure the
        results for a single or multiple instruments. This software is didferent
        it that it intends to experiment with the entry and exit rules and see how
        those adjustments impact results.
        
        ## Structure
        
        Core Framework lives in this repo, and your secret sauce parameter/configs,
        research findings live in another one.
        
        This repo will feel like a mono repo to many, and focuses on
        
        - downloading market data (currently using IB API Gateway)
        - exposing market data
        - running multi-variate simulations
        - reporting results
