Description: # cursewords
        
        `cursewords` is a "graphical" command line program for solving crossword puzzles in the terminal. It can be used to open files saved in the widely used AcrossLite `.puz` format.

        `cursewords` includes nearly every major feature you might expect in a crossword program, including:
        
        * intuitive navigation
        * answer-checking for squares, words, and full puzzles
        * a pausable puzzle timer
        * a puzzle completeness notification
        
        It is currently under active development, and should not be considered fully "released." That said, it is stable and suitable for everyday use.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `cursewords` is only compatible with `python3`, and can be installed through `pip`. If you don't know what that means, the best command is probably:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install --user cursewords
        ```
        
        You should then be ready to go. You can then use  `cursewords` to open `.puz` files directly:
        
        ```
        cursewords todaysnyt.puz
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        If you've used a program to solve crossword puzzles, navigation should be pretty intuitive. `tab` and `shift+tab` are the workhorses for navigation between blanks. `page up` and `page down` (on Mac, `Fn+` up/down arrow keys) jump between words without considering blank spaces. `ctrl+g`, followed by a number, will jump directly to the space with that number.
        
        If you need some help, `ctrl+c` will check the current square, word, or entire puzzle for errors, and `ctrl+r` will reveal answers (subject to the same scoping options). To clear all entries on the puzzle, use `ctrl+x`, and to reset the puzzle to its original state (resetting the timer and removing any stored information about hints and corrections, use `ctrl+z`.
        
        To open a puzzle in `downs-only` mode, where only the down clues are visible, use the `--downs-only` flag when opening the file on the command line.
