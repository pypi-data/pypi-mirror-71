# distGaussianBinomial package

This package provides users with the ability to obtain the mean and standard deviation of Gaussian or Binomial distributions, as well as the sum of distributions. Further capabilities include methods that plot your distribution data, as well as plot probability density functions (PDF) of your data.

# Files

The `distributions` folder contains the code for the package. Methods and attributes for Binomial distributions are defined in `Binomialdistribution.py`, while those for the Gaussian distributions are defined in `Gaussiandistribution.py`. `Generaldistribution.py` contains the attributes and methods for generating a probability distribution of a generic class. 

# Installation
run `pip install distGaussianBinomial` in your command line
