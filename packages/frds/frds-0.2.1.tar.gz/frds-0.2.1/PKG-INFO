        [frds](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds/) is a Python framework that aims to provide the simplest way to compute a collection of major academic measures used in the finance literature, one-click with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
        
        ![GUI](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds/raw/master/images/frds_demo.gif)
        
        ## Installation & Configuration
        
        [frds](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds/) requires Python3.8 or higher. To install using `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install frds
        ```
        After installation, a folder `frds` will be created under your user's home directory, which contains a `data` folder, a `result` folder and a default configuration file `config.ini`:
        
        ```ini
        [Paths]
        base_dir: ~/frds
        data_dir: ${base_dir}/data
        result_dir: ${base_dir}/result
        
        [Login]
        wrds_username: 
        wrds_password: 
        ```
        
        You need to enter your WRDS username and password under the login section.
        
        ## Usage
        
        To start estimating various measures, run `frds` as a module:
        
        ```bash
        $ python -m frds.gui.run
        ```
        
        Alternatively, run without GUI:
        
        ```bash
        $ python -m frds.run
        ```
        
        The output data will be saved as STATA `.dta` file in the `result` folder.
        
        ## Example Output
        
        Below is an example output for [`tangibility`](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds/blob/master/frds/measures/tangibility.py), defined as the Property, Plant and Equipment (Net) scaled by Assets (Total), estimated for all firms in the Compustat Fundamental Annual. The result dataset is saved in `/result/Tangibility.dta`.
