Python bindings to the OpenStack Manila API
===========================================

This is a client for OpenStack Manila API. There's :doc:`a Python API
<user/api>` (the :mod:`manilaclient` module), and a :doc:`command-line script
<user/shell>` (installed as :program:`manila`). Each implements the entire
OpenStack Manila API. See :ref:`project-structure` for more information.

You'll need credentials for an OpenStack cloud that implements the
Manila API in order to use the manila client.
