Description: =============
        GRAINS_COWSAY
        =============
        
        ** A simple example of a vertically app merged grains project **
        
        
        INSTALLATION
        ============
        
        
        
        With git::
        
            git clone https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/grains.git
            pip install -e grains
        
        With pip::
        
            pip install corn_cowsay
        
        
        EXECUTION
        =========
        After installation the `grains` command should now be available if it wasn't already
        
        
        TESTING
        =======
        install `requirements-test.txt` with pip and run pytest::
        
            pip install -r grains/requirements-test.txt
            pytest grains/tests
        
        VERTICAL APP-MERGING
        ====================
        Instructions for extending grains like this project does
        
        Install pop::
        
            pip install --upgrade pop
        
        Create a new directory for the project::
        
            mkdir grains_{project}
            cd grains_{project}
        
        
        Use `pop-seed` to generate the structure of a project that extends `grains`::
        
            pop-seed -t v pop_{kernel} -d grains
        
        * "-t v" specifies that this is a vertically app-merged project
        *  "-d grains" says that we want to implement the dynamic name of "grains"
        
        Add "grainsv2" to the requirements.txt::
        
            echo "grainsv2" >> requirements.txt
        
        Note* url based reqs aren't supported on older versions of setuptools
        To pip install your vertically app-merged project install grains manually::
        
            pip install -e git+https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/grains.git#egg=grainsv2
        
        And that's it!  Go to town extending grains
        Follow the conventions you see in gitlab.com/satlstack/pop/grains
