    """PUSOSimulation.

    ``PUSOSimulation`` uses a Metropolis algorithm to simulate a PUSO.
    The spin system can be "updated" at a temperature ``T``. Thus, we can get
    an idea of the time evolution of a spin system by creating a temperature
    schedule and seeing how the system evolves. Please note that the
    ``qv.sim.QUSOSimulation`` performs the simulation much faster than the
    ``qv.sim.PUSOSimulation`` object, but of course only works with degree 1 or
    2 models. If your PUSO is degree two (thus a QUSO), then you should use
    the ``QUSOSimulation`` object.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider the example of the ferromagnetic chain.

    >>> import qubovert as qv
    >>>
    >>> length = 50
    >>> spin_system = sum(
    >>>     -qv.spin_var(i) * qv.spin_var(i+1) * qv.spin_var(i+2)
    >>>     for i in range(length-2)
    >>> )
    >>>
    >>> # initial state is all spin down
    >>> initial_state = {i: -1 for i in range(length)}
    >>> sim = qv.sim.PUSOSimulation(spin_system, initial_state)
    >>>
    >>> # define a schedule. here we simulate at temperature 4 for 25 time
    >>> # steps, then temperature 2 for 25 time steps, then temperature 1 for
    >>> # 10 time steps.
    >>> schedule = (4, 25), (2, 25), (1, 10)
    >>> sim.schedule_update(schedule)
    >>>
    >>> print("final state", sim.state)
    >>> print("last 30 states", sim.get_past_states(30))

        Parameters
        ----------
        H : dict or type in ``qubovert.SPIN_MODELS``.
            The PUSO to simulate. This should map tuples of spin variable
            labels to their respective coefficient in the Hamiltonian. For more
            information, see the docstrings for any of the models in
            ``qubovert.SPIN_MODELS``.
        initial_state : dict (optional, defaults to None).
            The initial state to start the simulation in. ``initial_state``
            should map spin label names to their initial values, where each
            value is either 1 or -1. If ``initial_state`` is None, then it
            will be initialized to all 1s.
        memory : int >= 0 (optional, defaults to 0).

            states that the simulation was in. These can be accessed with
            ``self.get_past_states(number_of_states)``.
