# ics.py vTimezone Data
This project independently packages the timezone data required by [`ics.py`](https://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/ics.py).
It includes the [Olson / IANA timezone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) converted to [iCalender vTimezone](https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-6-5-time-zone-component.html) files by [vzic](https://github.com/libical/vzic/)
and the [Unicode CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/index) mapping of [Windows timezone names](http://cldr.unicode.org/development/development-process/design-proposals/extended-windows-olson-zid-mapping) to the Olson identifiers.

Having a separate project from ics.py allows regular releases when the timezone data changes
(which is not as seldom as you might think) without having to do a new release of `ics.py`.
Similar to `pytz`, this project follows the `YYYY.minor` [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/) scheme representing the periodic updates of its data,
while `ics.py` uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to allow ensuring compatibility with its more gradually evolving code-base.
