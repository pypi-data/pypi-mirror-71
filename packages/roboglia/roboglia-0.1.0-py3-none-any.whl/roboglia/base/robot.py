class BaseRobot():
    """A complete representation of a robot.

    A robot has at minimum one ``Bus`` and one ``Device``. You can create
    a robot programatically by calling the constructor and providing all
    the parameters required or use an initialization dictionary or a YAML
    file. The last option is the preferred one considering the volume of
    information usually needed to describe a robot.

    For initializing a robot from a dictionary definition use
    :py:meth:`~BaseRobot.from_dict` class method. For instantiating from a
    YAML file use :py:meth:`~BaseRobot.from_yaml` class method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        the name of the robot; will default to **ROBOT**

    buses: dict
        a dictionary with buses definitions; the components
        of the buses are defined by the attributes of the particular
        class of the bus

    inits: dict
        a dictionary of register initialization; should have the following
        form::

            inits:
                init_template_1:
                    register_1: value
                    register_2: None     # this indicates 'read initialization'
                init_template_2:
                    register_3: value
                    register_4: value

        see also the :py:class:`BaseDevice` where the details of the
        initialization process are described

    devices: dict
        a dictionary with the device definitions; the
        components of devices are defined by the attributes of the
        particular class of device

    joints: dict
        a dictionary with the joint definitions; the
        components of the joints are defined by the attributes of the
        particular class of joint

    sensors: dict
        a dictionary with the sensors defintion; the components of the
        sensor are defined by the attributes of the particular class of
        sensor

    groups: dict
        a dictionary with the group definitions; the groups
        end up unwind in the robot as sets (eliminates duplication) and
        they are defined by the following components (keys in the
        dictionary defintion): ``devices``  a list of device names
        in no particular order, ``joints`` a list of joint names in
        no particular order, ``sensors`` a list of sensors in no
        particular order and ``groups`` a list of sub-groups that were
        previously defined and will be included in the current group.
        Technically it is possible to mix and match the components of
        a group (for instance create groups that contain devices, sensors,
        and joints).

    syncs: dict
        a dictionary with sync loops definitions; the components
        of syncs are defined by the attributes of the particular class of
        sync.

    Parameters
    ----------
    joints: list of :py:class:roboglia.Base.`Joint` or subclass
        The list of joints that the manager is having under control.
        Alternatively you can use the parameter ``group`` (see below)

    group: set of :py:class:roboglia.Base.`Joint` or subclass
        A group of joints that was defined earlier with a ``group``
        statement in the robot definition file.

    function: str
        The function used to produce the blended command for the joints. If
        specific functions for position (``p_function``), velocity (
        ``v_function``) or load (``ld_function``) are not supplied, then
        this function is used.
        Allowed values are 'mean', 'median', 'min', 'max'.

    p_function: str
        A specific function to be used for aggregating the position values.
        Allowed values are 'mean', 'median', 'min', 'max'.

        Parameters
        ----------
        stream: BaseThread or subclass
            The stream providing the data. It is used to keep the
            request separate and be able to merge later.

        commands: dict
            A dictionary with the commands requests in the format::

                {joint_name: (values)}

            Where ``values`` is a tuple with the command for that joint. It
            is acceptable to send partial commands to a joint, for instance
            you can send only (100,) meaning position 100 to a JointPVL.
            Submitting more information to a joint will have no effect, for
            instance (100, 20, 40) (position, velocity, load) to a Joint will
            only use the position part of the request.

        adjustments: bool
            Indicates that the values are to be treated as adjustments to
            the other requests instead of absolute requests. This is
            convenient for streams that request postion correction like
            an accelerometer based balance control. Internally the
            JointManger keeps the commands separate between the absolute
            and the adjustments ones and calculates separate averages then
            adjusts the absolute results with the ones from the adjustments
            to produce the final numbers.

        Returns
        -------
        bool:
            ``True`` if the operation was successful. False if there was an
            error (most likely the lock was not acquired). Caller needs to
