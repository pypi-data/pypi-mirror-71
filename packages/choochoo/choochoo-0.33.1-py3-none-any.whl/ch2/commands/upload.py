def upload(args, system, db):

## upload

    > ch2 upload --kit ITEM [ITEM...] -- PATH [PATH ...]

Upload FIT files, storing the data in the permanent store on the file system.
Optionally (if not --fast), scan the files and appropriate entries to the database.
Both monitor and activity files are accepted.

Files are checked for duplication on uploading (before being scanned).

If the uploaded file is mapped to a file path that already exists then we check the following cases:
* If the hash matches then the new data are discarded (duplicate).
* If the hash is different, it is an error (to avoid losing activity diary entries which are keyed by hash).

If the uploaded file has a hash that matches a file already read into the database, but the file path does not match,
then it is an error (internal error with inconsistent naming or duplicate data).

If --unsafe is given then files whose hashes match existing files are simply ignored.
This allows data downloaded en massed from Garmin to be uploaded ignoring already-uploaded data (with kit).

In short, hashes should map 1-to-1 to file names and to activities, and it is an error if they do not.

### Examples

    > ch2 upload --kit cotic -- ~/fit/2018-01-01.fit

will store the given file, add activity data to the database (associated with the kit 'cotic'), check for
new monitor data, and update statistics.

Note: When using bash use `shopt -s globstar` to enable ** globbing.
