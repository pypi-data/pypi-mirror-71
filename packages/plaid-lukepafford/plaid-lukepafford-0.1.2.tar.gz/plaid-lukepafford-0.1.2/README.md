# plaid_lukepafford

Uses Plaid to instantiate a Chase connection and save transaction data
locally.

Graphs and summaries will be built that I find interesting.

Main object is at `plaid_lukepafford.transactions.ChaseTransactions`

# Install

### Install package
`pip install plaid_lukepafford`

### Fetch transactions from Plaid API. (This will fail if you don't provide correct environment variables)
`chase-plaid fetch-latest-transactions`

### Display a table summarizing results
`chase-plaid money-spent-on-food`
```
