Description: # Welcome to nangs
        
        > Solving Partial Differential Equations with Neural Networks.
        
        Nangs is a Python library built on top of Pytorch to solve Partial Differential Equations.
        
        Our objective is to develop a new tool for simulating nature, using Neural Networks as solution approximation to Partial Differential Equations, increasing accuracy and optimziation speed while reducing computational cost.
        
        Read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04737) to know more.
        
        ## Installing
        
        nangs is on PyPI so you can just run:
        
        `pip install nangs`
        
        You will also need to insall [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        - Learn how to work with nangs with our [tutorials](https://github.com/juansensio/nangs/tree/master/tutorials).
        - See nangs in actions with our [examples](https://github.com/juansensio/nangs/tree/master/examples).
