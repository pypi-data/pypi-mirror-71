        This package provides support for semantic URIs for objects using the
        `tag URI scheme <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_URI_scheme>`_.
        These tag URIs are used to look up objects in an application, usually
        independent of their traversal path. These URIs, structured in a
        particular way, are called NTIIDs. When represented as strings, they
        use the Python text (unicode) type.
        
        In the ``specific`` part of the URI, each NTIID includes a type. A
        type is essentially a namespace in which the rest of the specific part
        is to be interpreted. A set of known types are defined in
        ``nti.ntiids.ntiids``, as are functions to parse and generate NTIIDs.
        
        The set of types is extensible through ``zope.component``
        registrations for important interfaces like
        ``nti.ntiids.interfaces.INTIIDResolver``, which is registered by name
        for specific types of NTIIDs. No resolvers are provided by this package.
        
        
        The package ``nti.ntiids.oids`` integrates with
        ``nti.externalization`` and serves as the hook used for external
        identifiers. These are derived from persistent ZODB object identifiers
        ("oid") with support for multiple databases (a multi-ZODB).
