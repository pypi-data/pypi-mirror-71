The commands are listed below in 3 categories `dev environment`, `utility` and `testing`. \n\nEach command can be executed with `invoke <command>`. All commands support the arguments `--netbox-ver` and `--python-ver` if you want to manually define the version of Python and NetBox to use. Each command also has its own help `invoke <command> --help`\n\n#### Local dev environment\n```\n  build            Build all docker images.\n  debug            Start NetBox and its dependencies in debug mode.\n  destroy          Destroy all containers and volumes.\n  start            Start NetBox and its dependencies in detached mode.\n  stop             Stop NetBox and its dependencies.\n```\n\n#### Utility \n```\n  cli              Launch a bash shell inside the running NetBox container.\n  create-user      Create a new user in django (default: admin), will prompt for password.\n  makemigrations   Run Make Migration in Django.\n  nbshell          Launch a nbshell session.\n```\n#### Testing \n\n```\n  tests            Run all tests for this plugin.\n  pylint           Run pylint code analysis.\n  pydocstyle       Run pydocstyle to validate docstring formatting adheres to NTC defined standards.\n  bandit           Run bandit to validate basic static code security analysis.\n  black            Run black to check that Python files adhere to its style standards.\n  unittest         Run Django unit tests for the plugin.\n```\n',
