# Named Searches

[Search queries](doc/searching.md) can become very long and it would be
tedious to type them again each time.

To get around it, you can save search queries and give them a name.

Named search queries are shared between the commandline GUI and the
webinterface.

The named queries are stored in your configuration folder in the file
`~/.config/pytodotxt/searches.cfg`.

Each line in that file is one saved search query in the form `name = search
query`.
