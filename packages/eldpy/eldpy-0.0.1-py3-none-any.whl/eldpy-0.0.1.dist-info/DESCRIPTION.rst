# LangSci

This package provides tools for interfacing with endangered language archives.

For the time being, only the download functionality is robust enough for general use.

The package contains script for the analysis of ELAN files. These analyses are quantitative (duration, tiers, tokens) as well as qualitative (vernacular language, tranlations, glosses, semantic domains).

The analyses are cached in JSON format and can be exported to RDF.

Usage:
> import run
> run.run()
