# Vaknl-gcp
Package for working with dataclasses and Google cloud instances as Bigquery and Storage. 
For this to work the dataclasses need to contain only basic python variables as: str, int, dict, list etc. 

## Prerequisites
These modules dependant on the environment variable GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT a.k.a. gcp project id. 

## Bigquery

#### execute_query(query):
Execute query and log errors
```
returns query_job
```

#### stream_to_bigquery(objects: list, table_ref):
Cast python objects to json and stream them to GBQ
Note: this is more expensive compared to using buckets but also quicker

```
returns table ref
```

#### write_disposition_bucket(table_ref, blob_name, write_disposition):
Get data from bucket to GBQ using a write_disposition method

Requires: bucket with name storage_to_bigquery-[project-id] 

- WRITE_DISPOSITION_UNSPECIFIED	Unknown.
- WRITE_EMPTY	This job should only be writing to empty tables.
- WRITE_TRUNCATE	This job will truncate table data and write from the beginning.
- WRITE_APPEND	This job will append to a table.

```
returns load_job.result 
```

## Storage

#### storage_to_bigquery(objects: list, table_ref, write_disposition):
Function that stores data into multiple storage blobs. Afterwards these wil be composed into one storage blob
The reason for this process is to downsize the sie of the data send to Google Cloud Storage.

Requires: bucket with name storage_to_bigquery-[project-id] 

#### get_bucket(name_bucket: str):
```
returns name_bucket
```

#### get_blobs_from_bucket(bucket):
```
returns blobs:list
```

#### upload_from_string(blob, string):
```
returns blob.public_url
```

## Tasks

#### def create_task(url, queue, payload, task_name=None, in_seconds=None):
```
returns Response
```

## Secrets (beta)

#### get_secret(secret_id):
```
returns json
```
