# This workflow is triggered two ways:
#
# 1. When a tag is created, the workflow will upload the package to
#    test.pypi.org.
# 2. When a release is made, the workflow will upload the package to pypi.org.
#
# It is done this way until PyPI has draft reviews, to allow for a two-stage
# upload with a chance for manual intervention before the final publication.
