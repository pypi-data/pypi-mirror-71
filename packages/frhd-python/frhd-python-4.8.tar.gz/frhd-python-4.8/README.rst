FRHD
====

Free Rider HD is an HTML5 game that utilizes the canvas element to
display an interactive biking game. This script allows you to make your
own tracks using Python! Let's go over the basic syntax:

First of all, import the library:

.. code:: python

    import frhd

Now create a track class:

.. code:: python

    my_track = frhd.Track.Track()

Now that you have the frontmatter out of the way, create a line by
calling

.. code:: python

    my_track.insLine('p', -40, 50, 100, 50)

The ``'p'`` in that statement tells the code to create a physics line.
Now you need to print out this code:

.. code:: python

    print(my_track.genCode())

To create a scenery line you use the same code as last time, with the
exception of replacing the ``'p'`` with an ``'s'``. What you have should
look like this:

.. code:: python

    import frhd
    my_track = frhd.Track.Track()
    my_track.insLine('s', -40, 50, 100, 50)
    print(my_track.genCode())

To add a boost just use this syntax:

.. code:: python

    my_track.insBoost(90,-10,90)

A quick note on how the coordinates work: The origin of the cartesian
coordinate plane (0,0) is located near the center of the rider. To see
where this is, turn on the grid in the editor. Zoom out. You should see
thicker, darker lines at certain intervals. Where they intersect inside
the rider is (0,0). When drawing a line, the first argument is the line type and then you can add as many coordinates as you want (e.g. my_track.insLine('p', x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)). When using any
kind of power-up, the third coordinate is acually degrees of rotation.
Every coordinate is one-tenth of a ten grid square (the default size
when you show the grid).

The other power-ups are as follows:

.. code:: python


    my_track.insBoost(90,-10,90) # Boost
    my_track.insBomb(90,10) # Bomb (no rotation as it is omni-directional)
    my_track.insGravity(90,10,90) # Gravity
    my_track.insCheck(90,10) # Checkpoint
    my_track.insStar(90,10) # Star
    my_track.insSlowMo(90,10) # Slow Motion


NOTE: As it is a pain to update the docs at pypi I will not keep these updated very well.

This project was inspired by frhd.js, a library made by ObeyLordGoomy that
does the same thing, but for JavaScript.
