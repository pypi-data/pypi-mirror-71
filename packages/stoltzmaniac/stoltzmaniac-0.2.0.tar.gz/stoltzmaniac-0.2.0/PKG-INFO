# stoltzmaniac  

A Python package to solve simple data science problems. 

This is a rudimentary library for machine learning with 3 concepts in mind. This library should be:
  - easy-to-use
  - easy-to-read
  - easy-to-interpret

Optimization for efficiency of compute, latency, and memory will not be a priority.

The only external package we will use for modeling will be `numpy`. Others required are simply to get data into `numpy.ndarray` format.

This is my first package, so help out and don't hold back on putting in PR's. Thank you!

Installing:
```bash
pip install stoltzmaniac
```
