Tacks is in development.

Project Goals:

  * One tool for one job: pin requirements to plain requirements.txt files.
  * Don't require changes to existing tools or workflows.
  * Output files compatible with standard `pip install`.
  * Manage pinning from the CLI. Add/remove dependencies while preserving comments and whitespace.
  * Integrate with task runners: Django, Flask, doit, Invoke, or user-defined.
  * Eject at any time. To stop using Tacks, just delete it.
  * Support Python 3.6+. Eventually expand to 2.7 and 3.5+.
