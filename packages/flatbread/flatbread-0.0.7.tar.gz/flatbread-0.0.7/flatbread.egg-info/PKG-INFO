Description: # Flatbread
        
        ## Name
        Initially I planned for this library to be called pita -- short for pivot tables. But as that name was already taken on pypi.org the choice fell on flatbread.
        
        ## About
        Flatbread is a library built upon pandas and matplotlib for displaying and presenting data. Under construction.
        
        ## Install
        To install:
        
        ```pip install flatbread```
