Description: *******
        IMSVDEX
        *******
        
        API to access and modify XML files in the ``IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange``
        format::
        
            The IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange (VDEX) specification defines a
            grammar  for the exchange of value lists of various classes: collections
            often denoted "vocabulary". Specifically, VDEX defines a grammar for the
            exchange of simple machine-readable lists of values, or terms, together with
            information that may aid a human being in understanding the meaning or
            applicability of the various terms. VDEX may be used to express valid data
            for use in instances of IEEE LOM, IMS Metadata, IMS Learner Information Package
            and ADL SCORM, etc, for example. In these cases, the terms are often not human
            language words or phrases but more abstract tokens. VDEX can also express
            strictly hierarchical schemes in a compact manner while allowing for more loose
            networks of relationship to be expressed if required.

        This module takes the VDEX-XML objects and offers an API to them.
        
        VDEX Version 1 Final Specification is supported, except VDEX references.
