        pdict
        =====
        
        pdict has a dictionary like interface and a sqlite backend.
        It uses pickle to store Python objects and strings, which are then compressed with zlib for storage in sqlite.
        Multithreaded interaction is supported.
        
        Depends on python 2.5+
        
        Example use: ::
        
            >>> filename = 'cache.db'
            >>> cache = pdict.PersistentDict(filename)
            >>> url = 'http://google.com/abc'
            >>> html = '<html>abc</html>'
            >>>
            >>> url in cache
            False
            >>> cache[url] = html
            >>> url in cache
            True
            >>> cache[url] == html
            True
            >>> cache.get(url)['value'] == html
            True
            >>> now = datetime.datetime.now()
            >>> cache.meta(url)
            {}
            >>> cache.meta(url, 'meta')
            >>> cache.meta(url)
            'meta'
            >>> del cache[url]
            >>> url in cache
            False
