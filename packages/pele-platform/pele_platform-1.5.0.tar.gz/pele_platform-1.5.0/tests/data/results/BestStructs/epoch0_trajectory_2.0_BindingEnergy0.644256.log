Working on structure 1
Fixing common structure mistakes...
  No mistakes were found
Assigning bond orders...
  Using CCD: True
CCD template assignment failed for HET "L01 " due to:
  Atom count mismatch between the HET and the CCD record.
  Falling back to bond order assignment based on geometry.
  Assigned the following bonds (format: atom1, atom2, order): {(1223, 1224, 2), (1225, 1233, 2)}
Removing and re-adding hydrogens...
Creating di-sulfur bonds...
   Created a bond between A:63 and A:23; changed residue names to "CYX "
   Created a bond between A:75 and A:51; changed residue names to "CYX "
   Created a bond between A:80 and A:2; changed residue names to "CYX "
