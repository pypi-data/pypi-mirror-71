Description: # Distribution Analyzer
        This package allows a user to perform some simple analysis of basic elements of Gaussian and Binomial Distributions.
        
        This package is primarily meant as a test case/POC for loading packages to PyPi, but may also be useful for some other people.
        
        To use this package:
        1. `pip install daigle-dist`
        2. run Python
        3. enter `from distributions import Gaussian, Binomial`<br>
        3a. `Gaussian(mean, stdev)`<br>
        3b. `Binomial(mean,stdev)`
        4. Attributes include:
        > * `read_data_file()`: assigns the distribution object some data from a .txt file
        > * `mean`: returns the distribution object's mean
        > * `stdev`: returns the distribution object's standard deviation
        > * `calculate_mean()`: assigns and returns a distribution object's mean
        > * `calculate_stdev()`: assigns and returns a distribution object's standard deviation
        > * `replace_stats_with_data()`: update attributes of p and n of binomial distribution object
        > * `plot_bar`: bar chart plot of the outcomes and frequencies of a distribution object
        > * `pdf()`: calculates the probability density function for a distribution object
        > * `plot_bar_pdf`: bar chart plot of the probability density function of a distribution object
        5. Magic Methods include:
        > * `__add__`: allows two distribution objects to be added to each other as well as calculate the mean and standard deviation of each other
        > * `__repr__`: outputs the characteristics of a distribution object
