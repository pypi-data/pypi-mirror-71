# AltAnalyze # 

An automated cross-platform workflow for RNA-Seq gene, splicing and pathway analysis 

AltAnalyze is an extremely user-friendly and open-source analysis tool that can be used for a broad range of genomics analyses. These analyses include the direct processing of raw [RNASeq](https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze/wiki/RNASeq) or microarray data files, advanced methods for [single-cell population discovery](http://altanalyze.blogspot.com/2016/08/introducing-powerful-and-easy-to-use.html), differential expression analyses, analysis of alternative splicing/promoter/polyadenylation and advanced isoform function prediction analysis (protein, domain and microRNA targeting). Multiple advanced visualization tools and [Ã  la carte analysis methods](https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze/wiki/Tutorials) are supported in AltAnalyze (e.g., network, pathway, splicing graph). AltAnalyze is compatible with various data inputs for [RNASeq](https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze/wiki/RNASeq) data ([FASTQ](http://altanalyze.blogspot.com/2016/08/using-ultrafast-sequence.html), [BAM](http://altanalyze.blogspot.com/2016/08/bye-bye-bed-files-welcome-bam.html), BED), microarray platforms ([Gene 1.0](https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze/wiki/AffyGeneArray), [Exon 1.0](https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze/wiki/AffyExonArray), [junction](https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze/wiki/JAY) and [3' arrays](https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze/wiki/CompatibleArrays)) for automated gene expression and splicing analysis. This software requires no advanced knowledge of bioinformatics programs or scripting or advanced computer hardware. User friendly [videos](https://www.google.com/#q=altanalyze&tbm=vid), [online tutorials](https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze/wiki/Tutorials) and [blog posts](http://altanalyze.blogspot.com/) are also available.
