Description: # onomancer
        *onomancer* is an open source python package for inferring gender from first names for feature engineering. Name-Gender mappings are based on lookups in the `F.txt, M.txt, N.txt` files located in the `data` folder created from combining data provided from the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) and [World Intellectual Property Organization](https://ideas.repec.org/s/wip/eccode.html). If a Name-Gender mapping does not exist, the gender is predicted from a pre-trained model named `model.bin` also located in the `data` folder.
